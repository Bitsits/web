<p>This is the fourth and final part in the Wizard series. We have
covered making a sprite move, jump and duck. Now, we're moving onto
creating projectiles and making your sprite shoot. </p>
<p><strong>Starting the game project:</strong>  </p>
<p>We are going to be building off everything that we did in the third part of the Wizard series&nbsp; "<a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/tutorials/thewizardducking/thewizardducking.shtml">The Wizard - Part 3: Making a Sprite Duck</a>". Instead of creating a new XNA Game project, you can just <a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/tutorials/thewizardducking/thewizardducking.zip">download the source</a> for that project and begin working from that game project.  </p>
<p><strong>Adding the images:</strong>  </p>
<p><img src="thewizardshooting_files/Fireball.png" alt="Fireball" style="border: 0px none ; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" align="left" border="0" width="100" height="81">
Now, let's add the new sprite image that we are going to be using in
this tutorial to the game project. You can download the Fireball image
used in the project from <a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/tutorials/thewizardshooting/wizardshootingimage.zip">here</a>.
Once you have downloaded the image, add the Fireball image to the
Content folder in your game. If you are having trouble remembering how
to add an image to an XNA Game project, just follow the steps in <a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/tutorials/addinganimagetothegameproject/AddingAnImageToTheGameProject.shtml">this tutorial here</a> and come back to this tutorial after you've refreshed your memory.  </p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Enhancing the Sprite class:</strong>  </p>
<p>We need to enhance the sprite class, but the change we're making is
going to be a very small one. Some of the changes we will be making
during this tutorial will require the ability for classes that inherit
from our Sprite class to "override" the Draw method. When a method in
an inherited class overrides a method in it's base class, that simply
means the inherited classes version of the method will be called
instead. This is typically done when an inherited class needs to either
replace some functionality in a method or when it needs to do something
before the functionality in the base class happens. </p>
<p>To indicate that an inherited class can override a method, the
method must be marked as "virtual", this has nothing to do with the XNA
framework, it's just basic object oriented programming and C# syntax.
To make our Draw method virtual, modify the Draw method in the
Sprite.cs class to look like the following.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="rem">//Draw the sprite to the screen</span></pre>
<pre>        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw(SpriteBatch theSpriteBatch)</pre>
<pre class="alt">        {</pre>
<pre>            theSpriteBatch.Draw(mSpriteTexture, Position, Source,</pre>
<pre class="alt">                Color.White, 0.0f, Vector2.Zero, Scale, SpriteEffects.None, 0);</pre>
<pre>        }</pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, nothing else changed, but the new keyword "virtual" was added to the the method signature. </p>
<p><strong>Adding the Fireball class:</strong></p>
<p>Our Wizard is going to shoot magic fireballs and we're going to make
a "Fireball" class to represent those. The Fireball class is going to
inherit from the Sprite class but add some fireballish type
functionality. Let's get started. Right-click on the the game project
in the Solution Explorer. Select, "Add", then pick "Class" from the add
sub-men. This will open up the "Add New Item" dialog. Type in the name
"Fireball" for your class and click the "Add" button. </p>
<p>Now we need to start adding some functionality to the Fireball
class. Let's start by adding our XNA framework "using" statements to
the top of the Fireball.cs class file. </p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt"><span class="kwrd">using</span> Microsoft.Xna.Framework;</pre>
<pre><span class="kwrd">using</span> Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content;</pre>
<pre class="alt"><span class="kwrd">using</span> Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;</pre>
</div>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<p>Now, let's see the Fireball class up to inherit from the Sprite
class. Change the class declaration for the Fireball to look like the
following. </p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Fireball : Sprite</pre>
</div>
<p>The Fireball class now inherits from the Sprite class and has access to all of it's public and protected members and methods.</p>
<p>To begin adding functionality to the Fireball class, we will start
out by adding some constant and class level objects that we will be
working with. Add the following code to the top of the Fireball.cs
class.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">const</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> MAX_DISTANCE = 500;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> Visible = <span class="kwrd">false</span>;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre class="alt">        Vector2 mStartPosition;</pre>
<pre>        Vector2 mSpeed;</pre>
<pre class="alt">        Vector2 mDirection;</pre>
</div>
<p>MAX_DISTANCE is a constant that indicates how far our Fireball can
travel before it disappears. Visible keeps track of whether the
Fireball should be visible any longer, so when it's traveled it's
maximum distance it wouldn't be Visible anymore. </p>
<p>We will use mStartPosition to store where the Fireball starts at so
we can keep track of how far it has traveled. Speed and Direction will
be used to move the Fireball.</p>
<p>Next, we want to loud our Fireball image. To do that, add the following "LoadContent" method to the Fireball class. </p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> LoadContent(ContentManager theContentManager)</pre>
<pre>        {</pre>
<pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.LoadContent(theContentManager, <span class="str">"Fireball"</span>);</pre>
<pre>            Scale = 0.3f;</pre>
<pre class="alt">        }</pre>
</div>
<p>We pass in the Asset name (Oh no! Refactor that "magic" string out!
Did you see it? Remember, random strings and numbers in your code can
lead to problems in the future.). That will load our Fireball image for
us that we added earlier. Next, we scale the Fireball down from it's
original size so that it looks appropriate for our Wizard sprite.</p>
<p>The Update logic is going to be a little different for the Fireball. Add the following Update method to the Fireball.cs class.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Update(GameTime theGameTime)</pre>
<pre>        {</pre>
<pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (Vector2.Distance(mStartPosition, Position) &gt; MAX_DISTANCE)</pre>
<pre>            {</pre>
<pre class="alt">                Visible = <span class="kwrd">false</span>;</pre>
<pre>            }</pre>
<pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (Visible == <span class="kwrd">true</span>)</pre>
<pre class="alt">            {</pre>
<pre>                <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Update(theGameTime, mSpeed, mDirection);</pre>
<pre class="alt">            }</pre>
<pre>        }</pre>
</div>
<p>We start out by checking to see just how far this Fireball has
traveled. We do that by using one of the methods of the Vector2 object
called "Distance". With distance, you can pass in a starting vector2
and an ending vector2 and it will calculate just how far apart they
are. If the fireball has traveled further then it's maximum distance,
then we say it should no longer be visible.</p>
<p>Next, we check to see if the Fireball is still visible. If it is,
then we pass it's current speed and direction (and the time that has
elapsed) to the base Sprite class so that the Position for the Fireball
sprite will be adjusted properly.</p>
<p>The Draw code will have some similar functionality. Add the following Draw method to the Fireball.cs class.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw(SpriteBatch theSpriteBatch)</pre>
<pre>        {</pre>
<pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (Visible == <span class="kwrd">true</span>)</pre>
<pre>            {</pre>
<pre class="alt">                <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Draw(theSpriteBatch);</pre>
<pre>            }</pre>
<pre class="alt">        }</pre>
</div>
<p>You can see that we used the keyword "override" in our Draw method.
This is why we had to mark the Draw method in the base Sprite class as
"virtual". Our Fireball doesn't want the base Draw functionality to
happen automatically. When some class calls Draw on a Fireball, it
first wants to make sure it's Visible, then if it is, it will go ahead
and call the base Draw functionality. Overriding methods is very useful
functionality!</p>
<p>Just one more method we need to add to our Fireball class. We want
something to start the Fireball in motion. To do that, add the
following "Fire" method to the Fireball.cs class.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Fire(Vector2 theStartPosition, Vector2 theSpeed, Vector2 theDirection)</pre>
<pre>        {</pre>
<pre class="alt">            Position = theStartPosition;            </pre>
<pre>            mStartPosition = theStartPosition;</pre>
<pre class="alt">            mSpeed = theSpeed;</pre>
<pre>            mDirection = theDirection;</pre>
<pre class="alt">            Visible = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;</pre>
<pre>        }</pre>
</div>
<p>The Fire method takes in a starting position, a speed and a
direction object. It uses these to set it's own objects so that when
Update is called the speed and direction will be set. It also sets the
Visible on the Fireball to true indicating the Fireball can now be
seen. </p>
<p>Now that we have our Fireball class created. Let's see how we're going to interact with it.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing the Wizard class:</strong></p>
<p>Our Wizard is going to gain the ability to shot Fireballs, but to do
that we're going to have to start writing some code. Let's start off
first by creating some object to keep track of the fireballs. Add the
following objects to the top of the Wizard.cs class.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        List&lt;Fireball&gt; mFireballs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> List&lt;Fireball&gt;();</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre class="alt">        ContentManager mContentManager;</pre>
</div>
<p>The Content Manager object will be used to create new Fireballs when
we need them. The LoadContent method of the Fireball class needs a
reference to the Content Manager so we need to have a reference hanging
around to pass to it. </p>
<p>The "List" object gives us a way of creating multiple types of
objects and keeping track of them. One of the neat things about the
List object is you can tell it what type of object you are going to be
keeping in it. In our case, we're going to be keeping track of Fireball
classes so we use that in our declaration. (for more information on
this type of thing, start reading up on C# generics. They're great!). </p>
<p>Next, we need to modify the LoadContent method. The LoadContent
method is called every time the graphics device is reset. That means
that all the content will need to be reloaded so not only our Wizard
image, but all the Fireballs as well. Modify the LoadContent method in
the Wizard.cs class to look like the following.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> LoadContent(ContentManager theContentManager)</pre>
<pre>        {</pre>
<pre class="alt">            mContentManager = theContentManager;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Fireball aFireball <span class="kwrd">in</span> mFireballs)</pre>
<pre>            {</pre>
<pre class="alt">                aFireball.LoadContent(theContentManager);</pre>
<pre>            }</pre>
<pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>            Position = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Vector2(START_POSITION_X, START_POSITION_Y);</pre>
<pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.LoadContent(theContentManager, WIZARD_ASSETNAME);</pre>
<pre>            Source = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(0, 0, 200, Source.Height);</pre>
<pre class="alt">        }</pre>
</div>
<p>We start by storing a reference to the ContentManager passed into
the Wizard's LoadContent method. We want that reference hanging around
so that when we have to add a new Fireball, it's available for us to
pass to the Fireball's LoadContent method.</p>
<p>Next, we cycle through all the current Fireballs we have in our list
and call LoadContent for them. The rest of the code was there from the
previous tutorials in the series.</p>
<p>The Update method now needs to start Updating our Fireballs as well.
Modify the Update method in the Wizard.cs class to look like the
following.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Update(GameTime theGameTime)</pre>
<pre>        {</pre>
<pre class="alt">            KeyboardState aCurrentKeyboardState = Keyboard.GetState();</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre class="alt">            UpdateMovement(aCurrentKeyboardState);</pre>
<pre>            UpdateJump(aCurrentKeyboardState);</pre>
<pre class="alt">            UpdateDuck(aCurrentKeyboardState);</pre>
<pre>            UpdateFireball(theGameTime, aCurrentKeyboardState);</pre>
<pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>            mPreviousKeyboardState = aCurrentKeyboardState;</pre>
<pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Update(theGameTime, mSpeed, mDirection);</pre>
<pre class="alt">        }</pre>
</div>
<p>We added a new line of code to call a method "UpdateFireball". So
let's go ahead and add that new method. now. Add the following
"UpdateFireball" method to the Wizard.cs class.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UpdateFireball(GameTime theGameTime, KeyboardState aCurrentKeyboardState)</pre>
<pre>        {</pre>
<pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Fireball aFireball <span class="kwrd">in</span> mFireballs)</pre>
<pre>            {</pre>
<pre class="alt">                aFireball.Update(theGameTime);</pre>
<pre>            }</pre>
<pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (aCurrentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.RightControl) == <span class="kwrd">true</span> &amp;&amp; mPreviousKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.RightControl) == <span class="kwrd">false</span>)</pre>
<pre class="alt">            {</pre>
<pre>                ShootFireball();</pre>
<pre class="alt">            }</pre>
<pre>        }</pre>
</div>
<p>The UpdateFireball method does the leg work for making sure that
each Fireball currently in our list gets Updated (so it can move). It
does this by cycling through all the Fireballs currently in the list
and calling their Update method. Next, it checks to see if the right
control key has been pressed (and wasn't pressed previously). If that's
true, then the Wizard will shoot a fireball. </p>
<p>Add the following "ShootFireball" method to the Wizard.cs class.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ShootFireball()</pre>
<pre>        {</pre>
<pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (mCurrentState == State.Walking)</pre>
<pre>            {</pre>
<pre class="alt">                <span class="kwrd">bool</span> aCreateNew = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;</pre>
<pre>                <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Fireball aFireball <span class="kwrd">in</span> mFireballs)</pre>
<pre class="alt">                {</pre>
<pre>                    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (aFireball.Visible == <span class="kwrd">false</span>)</pre>
<pre class="alt">                    {</pre>
<pre>                        aCreateNew = <span class="kwrd">false</span>;</pre>
<pre class="alt">                        aFireball.Fire(Position + <span class="kwrd">new</span> Vector2(Size.Width / 2, Size.Height / 2), </pre>
<pre>                            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Vector2(200, 0), <span class="kwrd">new</span> Vector2(1, 0));</pre>
<pre class="alt">                        <span class="kwrd">break</span>;</pre>
<pre>                    }</pre>
<pre class="alt">                }</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre class="alt">                <span class="kwrd">if</span> (aCreateNew == <span class="kwrd">true</span>)</pre>
<pre>                {</pre>
<pre class="alt">                    Fireball aFireball = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Fireball();</pre>
<pre>                    aFireball.LoadContent(mContentManager);</pre>
<pre class="alt">                    aFireball.Fire(Position + <span class="kwrd">new</span> Vector2(Size.Width / 2, Size.Height / 2), </pre>
<pre>                        <span class="kwrd">new</span> Vector2(200, 200), <span class="kwrd">new</span> Vector2(1, 0));</pre>
<pre class="alt">                    mFireballs.Add(aFireball);</pre>
<pre>                }</pre>
<pre class="alt">            }</pre>
<pre>        }</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ok, there's a lot going on in this method. First, nothing happens
unless the Wizards current state is Walking. At this point in time
(unless you start making some changes to the code as you're playing),
our Wizard can't shoot when in any other state (like ducking or
jumping). </p>
<p>The next bit of code is probably overkill for this little sample,
but I thought it was a good thing to go over so you have this little
trick available for future projects. Creating and destroying objects is
expensive. A much better technique is to keep them around, but have
them in an inactive, dead or invisible state. Then when you need to
create a new object of that type, you just check your list to see if
there are any not being used and you re-use them. </p>
<p>So first we start out by setting a flag called "aCreateNew". We set
this to true initially to indicate we have to create a new Fireball.
Next, we cycle through all the fireballs in our list checking to see if
any aren't currently being used. We know they're not being used because
they won't be Visible any longer. When we find one that isn't visible,
we change our flag to say we don't need to create a new one because we
found one we are going to reuse instead.</p>
<p>Then, we call the "Fire" method on the Fireball to reset all it's
own internal objects and start it on it's own merry little magic
fireball way again.</p>
<p>The second part of the ShootFireball method covers the case that we
couldn't reuse one of the existing Fireballs. For those cases, we have
to create a new one. So if our flag still indicates we need to create a
new one, create a new one we will do. We declare a new Fireball object,
call LoadContent passing in our reference to the Content Manager and
then we Fire the Fireball. Finally, we add taht Fireball to our list.</p>
<p>Now that we're shooting Fireballs, we need to start drawing them to
the screen. Add the following Draw method to the Wizard.cs class.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw(SpriteBatch theSpriteBatch)</pre>
<pre>        {</pre>
<pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Fireball aFireball <span class="kwrd">in</span> mFireballs)</pre>
<pre>            {</pre>
<pre class="alt">                aFireball.Draw(theSpriteBatch);</pre>
<pre>            }</pre>
<pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Draw(theSpriteBatch);</pre>
<pre>        }</pre>
</div>
<p>Again, we're overriding the base Sprite classes Draw method so we
can draw our Fireballs first. Once we're done with that, we call the
base classes Draw method so the Wizard will then draw.</p>
<p>That's it! Go ahead and do a <strong>Build <img src="thewizardshooting_files/CropperCapture26324_thumb44.jpg" alt="CropperCapture26324_thumb44" style="border: 0px none ;" border="0" width="31" height="27"> </strong>and move and jump, ducks and set the screen ablaze with your mighty magic fireballs! </p>

<p>Congratulations! You have successfully added the ability for your
Wizard to shot fireballs. You also gotten a taste for how to handle
projectiles and multiple sprites on the screen. Can you think of some
things in the project you could change? Would you make the Wizard shoot
out other Wizards instead of fireballs? Could you make the size of the
Fireballs larger and smaller? Could you make them move faster and
slower? Could you make them look blue or green?</p>
<p>Play with it, experiment and ask questions. Most of all make sure you&#8217;re having fun! </p>
