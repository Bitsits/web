<h2>You have been Selected!</h2> 

<b>How to create a selection box.</b> 

<p>In this tutorial, we will show how to create a selection box. A
selection box is the dotted line&nbsp;rectangle that&nbsp;you see in
most real time strategy (RTS) games that is used to select your units.
This tutorial will cover how to go about creating a dynamically sized
rectangular selection box that could be useful in creating your own RTS
game. </p> <p><strong><u>Creating the new game project:</u></strong></p> <p>To
start, first create a new Windows Game Project. This can be done by
launching XNA Game Studio Express and then selecting File -&gt; New
Project from the Menu.</p> <p>In the New Project window, select the
"Windows Game" template and then give the project a name and choose a
location to save the project.</p> <p align="center"><a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/CropperCapture1352.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-width: 0px;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/CropperCapture135_thumb.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="467"></a> </p> <p>Let's stop here and do a quick <strong>build</strong> <a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/CropperCapture1335.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-width: 0px;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/CropperCapture133_thumb3.jpg" border="0" width="40" height="36"></a>
so you can see the power of XNA (and so we can verify that the project
was created correctly and that your video card supports the minimum XNA
requirements).</p> <p>When you run the project, you should be greeted
with a Cornflower blue window. If you're seeing this lovely shade of
blue, then you have successfully setup your new game project.</p> <div align="center"><a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/CropperCapture1372.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-width: 0px;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/CropperCapture137_thumb.jpg" border="0" width="614" height="480"></a> &nbsp;</div> <div align="center">&nbsp;</div> <p>If you have an error, then your video card most likely does not meet the minimum requirements for XNA. See the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/xna/faq/">XNA FAQ</a>
from the Microsoft site for the minimum requirements and verify that
your video card does&nbsp;meet those requirements. If you believe your
video card does meet those requirement and are still getting an error,
then I recommend you&nbsp;head on over to the <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=20&amp;SiteID=1">MSDN XNA Forums</a>
and describe the error you are getting ask for some&nbsp; help there
(you will probably see me around there, I find them to be a great place
to hang out).</p> <div align="left">&nbsp;</div> <div align="left">&nbsp;</div> <div align="left"><strong><u>Making the&nbsp;Mouse Pointer&nbsp;Visible:</u></strong></div> <div align="left"><strong><u></u></strong>&nbsp;</div> <p>We
will start things off in this little project by making the mouse
pointer visible for our game. By default, XNA games start out with the
mouse pointer being invisible. This is because for most games you will
most likely want to make a custom mouse pointer to be displayed instead
of the standard windows mouse pointer. For us however, the standard
windows mouse pointer will work just fine so we will go ahead and make
it visible now.</p></div> <div align="left">&nbsp; <p>To make the mouse pointer visible in the game, add the following line of code to the Initialize method.</p> <div align="left">&nbsp;</div> <div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Initialize()</pre><pre>        {</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//Make the mouse pointer visible in the game window</span></pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">this</span>.IsMouseVisible = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;</pre><pre class="alt">        }</pre></div>

<p>Time to do a quick <strong>build</strong> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/CropperCapture1335.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-width: 0px;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/CropperCapture133_thumb3.jpg" border="0" width="40" height="36"></a>&nbsp;of the project again so you can wave your newly visible mouse pointer around the game window with pride. </p>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left"><strong><u>Adding the image:</u></strong></div>
<div align="left"><strong><u></u></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<p>
Next, let's add the image to the project that we are going to use when
we draw the selection box rectangle. This image consists of a
transparent area, a rectangular white dash and then some more
transparent area. (the image does not appear transparent when viewed
through the web, but the dark areas are the transparent areas)</p>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/DottedLine3.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-width: 0px;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/DottedLine_thumb1.png" border="0" width="240" height="55"></a> </div>
<div align="center">&nbsp;</div>
<p>
The image is provided in the source file for this tutorial. Save the
image to your project folder and now we will add it to the project
itself.
</p>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<p>
To add an image to the game project. <b>Right-click on the project</b> name and select "Add -&gt; Existing Item". This will open the "Add Existing Item" dialog.
</p>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">
<p>This dialog box defaults to show only Visual C# Files which mean you
will not see any&nbsp;images&nbsp;until you change this. We want to use
the Content Pipeline to manage our images so from the "Files of type:"
combo box, select "Content Pipeline Files". Now you should be able to
navigate to your image. Select&nbsp;the image&nbsp;and then click the
"Add" button. You have now <b>successfully added an image</b> to your game project.</p>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>

<div align="center">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left"><b><u>Drawing the Image:</u></b></div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">
<p>We have created the game project, made the mouse pointer visible and
added an image, now let's go ahead and write a little code to make that
image <b>draw on the screen</b>.&nbsp;</p></div>
<div align="left">
<p>Start by adding two new objects to the class. These objects will take care of drawing the image and storing the image.&nbsp;</p></div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        SpriteBatch mSpriteBatch;</pre><pre>        Texture2D mDottedLine;</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre></div>
<p></p>
<p>This "SpriteBatch" object is used to draw your images. The
"Texture2D" object is used to store your images.&nbsp;Both of
these&nbsp;types of objects are used very frequently when creating 2D
games with XNA, so learning to use them and all that they can do
becomes very important. We will only be scratching the surface of what
you can do with just these two objects in this tutorial.</p>
<p>Now that we our objects, we need to<b> initialize them and use them</b>.
To initialize the objects, we are going to add some code to the
"LoadGraphicsContent" method that was automatically created for us when
we selected the Windows Game template.</p>
<p>Add the following code to the "LoadGraphicsContent" method.&nbsp;</p><!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> LoadGraphicsContent(<span class="kwrd">bool</span> loadAllContent)</pre><pre>        {</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (loadAllContent)</pre><pre>            {</pre><pre class="alt">                <span class="rem">// TODO: Load any ResourceManagementMode.Automatic content</span></pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">                <span class="rem">//Initialize the sprite batch</span></pre><pre>                mSpriteBatch = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SpriteBatch(<span class="kwrd">this</span>.graphics.GraphicsDevice);</pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>                <span class="rem">//Create the Content Manager object to load images </span></pre><pre class="alt">                ContentManager aLoader = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ContentManager(<span class="kwrd">this</span>.Services);</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">                <span class="rem">//Use the Content Manager to load the Dotted Line image into the Texture2D object</span></pre><pre>                mDottedLine = aLoader.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(<span class="str">"DottedLine"</span>) <span class="kwrd">as</span> Texture2D;</pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>            }</pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>            <span class="rem">// TODO: Load any ResourceManagementMode.Manual content</span></pre><pre class="alt">        }</pre></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we initialized our SpriteBatch. If we had forgotten to
initialize it, when we tried to use this object later, we would have
gotten an error that "Object reference was not set to an instance of an
object". When developing with objects, this becomes a fairly frequent
error to see. Once you get it, you know that somewhere in your code <b>you forgot to initialize an object</b>. </p>
<p>Then we created a new object, a "ContentManager" object, to be used
just within this method. The ContentManager object is used to load our
images.</p>
<p>Finally, we used the newly created "ContentManager" object to load
our "DottedLine" image and store it in our Texture2D object.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that we have initialized all of our objects,<b> we can draw</b>
our&nbsp;Dotted line&nbsp;to the screen. To actually draw the image to
the screen, we will add some code to the "Draw" method. The "Draw"
method is another one of the base methods that was automatically
created for us when we made a new Windows Game project.</p>
<p>Add the following code to the "Draw" method.&nbsp;</p><!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw(GameTime gameTime)</pre><pre>        {</pre><pre class="alt">            graphics.GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">// TODO: Add your drawing code here</span></pre><pre>            mBatch.Begin();</pre><pre class="alt">            mBatch.Draw(mDottedLine, <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(0, 0, 10, 5), Color.White);</pre><pre>            mBatch.End();</pre><pre class="alt">             </pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Draw(gameTime);</pre><pre class="alt">        }</pre></div>
<p>First, we are going to change the color we are clearing the screen
with from the default "CornflowerBlue" to "Black". Our image is a white
dotted line so it just shows up a bit better on a black background.</p>
<p>Next, we let the SpriteBatch object know that <b>we are ready</b> to begin drawing some things. </p>
<p>Then we draw our image using the SpriteBatch. In this case, we told
the SpriteBatch which image we wanted to draw (our DotteLineTexture2D
object), where we wanted to draw it, how big we wanted the image to be
and what color we wanted to shade the image. We told the SpriteBatch
where we wanted to draw the image and how big we wanted to make it when
we passed in that Rectangle object. The first two values of the
Rectangle object tell the SpriteBatch which x, y location we want to
start drawing our image. In this case, we told the SpriteBatch that we
wanted to draw it at the (0,0) point on the screen which is the upper
left of the screen. The next two values of the Rectangle object tell
the SpriteBatch how wide and how high we want the image to be. In this
case we used a width of 10 pixels and a height of 5
pixels.&nbsp;Finally, the Color value we chose was White. This tells
the SpriteBatch that we don't want to apply any coloring to the image
at this time.</p>
<p>Last, <b>we tell the SpriteBatch</b> object that we are done drawing are images. </p>
<p>Now that we have created our objects and drawn the image to the screen, let's <b>do a quick build</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/CropperCapture1335.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-width: 0px;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/CropperCapture133_thumb3.jpg" border="0" width="40" height="36"></a> to make sure that we have coded everything properly and that there are no errors.</p>
<p>When you do the build you should be presented with a screen like
this one. Just black with a little with dash in the upper left corner.
Pretty exciting right?</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/CropperCapture1392.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border: 0px none ;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/CropperCapture139_thumb.jpg" border="0" width="614" height="480"></a> </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b><u>Drawing the Image where the Left Click occurs:</u></b></p>
<p align="left">Now that we are actually <b>drawing the image</b> to
the screen, let's enhance the code to only draw the image when a left
click occurs. For this project, the player is going to start making the
selection box when they left click with the mouse and we are going to
start achieving that effect by drawing the image where they left click.
We will erase the image when they release the left click to simulate
what happens when the player is finished with their selection
box.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">So left click, draw the image at the current mouse
location and maintain it at that location. Release the left mouse
button, erase the image. Got it?</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">To start, add the following code to the top of your class after the SpriteBatch and Texture2D object declarations.</p>
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        Rectangle mSelectionBox;</pre><pre>        MouseState mPreviousMouseState;</pre></div>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">The Rectangle object (mSelectionBox), will be use to
track the current location of the mouse click (the x,y location the
mouse click occurred). The MouseState object (mPreviousMouseState) will
be used to store the previous state the mouse was in (was the left
button clicked or released last time).</p>
<p aling="left">First we will need to initialize these two objects. Add the following code to the Initialize method:</p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Initialize()</pre><pre>        {</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">// TODO: Add your initialization logic here</span></pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//Make the mouse pointer visible in the game window</span></pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">this</span>.IsMouseVisible = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;</pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>            <span class="rem">//Initialize the Selection box's rectangle. Currently no selection box is drawn</span></pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//so set it's x and y position to -1 and it's height and width to 0</span></pre><pre>            mSelectionBox = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(-1, -1, 0, 0);</pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>            <span class="rem">//Initialize the previous mouse state. This stores the current state of the mouse</span></pre><pre class="alt">            mPreviousMouseState = Mouse.GetState();</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Initialize();</pre><pre>        }</pre></div>
<p aling="left">Your beautiful mouse visible code should still remain
and we have now added our initialization for the SelectionBox rectangle
object and the previous state of the Mouse.</p>
<p aling="left">The mSelectionBox variable is started with no position
(the game has just started so the player has not left clicked yet so
there should not be any x or y position set).</p>
<p aling="left">The PreviousMouseState variable just gets the current state of the mouse when the game starts.</p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">Next, we need to add some code to the Update method to
detect when the left mouse button is clicked and release and to store
the current position of the mouse when the player does click the left
mouse button.</p>
<p aling="left">Add the following code to the Update method:</p>
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Update(GameTime gameTime)</pre><pre>        {</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">// Allows the default game to exit on Xbox 360 and Windows</span></pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed)</pre><pre class="alt">                <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Exit();</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">// TODO: Add your update logic here</span></pre><pre>        </pre><pre class="alt">            </pre><pre>            <span class="rem">//Get the current state of the Mouse</span></pre><pre class="alt">            MouseState aMouse = Mouse.GetState();</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//If the user has just clicked the Left mouse button, then set the start location for the Selection box</span></pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (aMouse.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed &amp;&amp; mPreviousMouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Released)</pre><pre class="alt">            {</pre><pre>                <span class="rem">//Set the starting location for the selection box to the current location</span></pre><pre class="alt">                <span class="rem">//where the Left button was initially clicked.</span></pre><pre>                mSelectionBox = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(aMouse.X, aMouse.Y, 0, 0);</pre><pre class="alt">            }          </pre><pre>                        </pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//If the user has released the left mouse button, then reset the selection square</span></pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (aMouse.LeftButton == ButtonState.Released)</pre><pre class="alt">            {</pre><pre>                <span class="rem">//Reset the selection square to no position with no height and width</span></pre><pre class="alt">                mSelectionBox = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(-1, -1, 0, 0);</pre><pre>            }</pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>            <span class="rem">//Store the previous mouse state</span></pre><pre class="alt">            mPreviousMouseState = aMouse;</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Update(gameTime);</pre><pre>        }</pre></div>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">When the game updates, the first thing that is done is
that we get the current state of the mouse (what buttons are currently
pressed and the current location of the mouse). </p>
<p aling="left">Next, we check to see if the left mouse button is
currently pressed. If it was AND it previous was not pressed (so the
player has JUST clicked it), then store the current x, y location of
the mouse. So mSelectionBox gets the current X (aMouse.X) and the
current Y (aMouse.Y) position of where the mouse pointer is on the
screen. This is where we will be drawing the image.</p>
<p aling="left">Now we check to see if the left button has been
released. If it has, we will remove the X, Y location for the image and
no longer draw it (we're only going to draw the image while the player
keeps the Left button click remember?).</p>
<p aling="left">Finally, we update the mPreviousMouseState variable
with the current mouse state. That way we can compare next time through
the Update method what the state of the mouse was in the previous
iteration.</p>
<p aling="left">Well, now we've Initialized our object, done some logic
in the Update and the final thing to do is to get some visual result.
To accomplish that we will change the code in our Draw method.</p>
<p aling="left">Add the following code to the Draw method:</p>
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw(GameTime gameTime)</pre><pre>        {</pre><pre class="alt">            graphics.GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">// TODO: Add your drawing code here</span></pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//Begin drawing with the batch</span></pre><pre>            mSpriteBatch.Begin();</pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (mSelectionBox.X != -1 &amp;&amp; mSelectionBox.Y != -1)</pre><pre class="alt">            {</pre><pre>                mSpriteBatch.Draw(mDottedLine, <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(mSelectionBox.X, mSelectionBox.Y, 10, 5), Color.White);</pre><pre class="alt">            }</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//End the drawing with the batch </span></pre><pre>            mSpriteBatch.End();</pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Draw(gameTime);</pre><pre class="alt">        }</pre></div>
<p aling="left">So we are still clearing the screen to Black (instead
of the lovely CornflowerBlue), however we've added a bit more logic to
the drawing of our image.</p>
<p aling="left">First, we check to make sure that the current X and Y
values for the mSelectionBox variable are not -1. When they are -1,
that means the player has released the Left mouse button and we should
no longer be drawing the dashed line image.</p>
<p aling="left">If the values are not -1, then we will draw our dotted
line image at the current&nbsp;position for the selection box (that is,
wherever the player first left clicked). </p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">Well, that's a lot. Let's go ahead and give the changes
we have made a quick test run to make sure we have done everything
correctly. Do a <b>build</b> <a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/CropperCapture1335.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-width: 0px;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/CropperCapture133_thumb3.jpg" border="0" width="40" height="36"></a>&nbsp;and
you should see the black screen. Nothing should be drawn to the screen
at first. Now, left click and you should see the small dash drawn. Keep
the left mouse button clicked and wave your mouse around. The image
should remain in the original location of the click. Now release the
mouse button and the image should disappear.</p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">Did you get the results you expected? Ready to add some more functionality? </p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left"><strong><u>Drawing a Horizontal line:</u></strong></p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">We have a dash, but a dash is a far cry from a box.
Let's get a little close to our final goal by drawing a horizontal
line. We want the line to start where the player clicks the left mouse
button and to expand and shrink in the X direction as they move their
mouse horizontally. </p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">To begin drawing our horizontal line, we will need to
track where the Mouse is moving to in the horizontal direction as the
player keeps the left mouse button pressed. This will require us to add
some more code to the Update method.</p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">Add the following code to the Update method:</p>

<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">There's only one section of the code above that has
changed from before. We added a new if...then block to check to see if
the Mouse button is currently pressed and if it is, then we update the
Width of our mSelectionBox variable.</p>
<p aling="left">To update the width, we take the current X location
(horizontal position) of the mouse and subtract the original point the
player clicked the mouse. This will tell us how wide (or long) we need
to make our horizontal line for our selection box.</p>
<p aling="left">That little block was all we needed to add to our
update logic. However, to actually draw the horizontal line, we need to
add a new method to our class. This method will draw our horizontal
line at a specified Y position. </p>
<p aling="left">Add the following method to the class:</p>
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DrawHorizontalLine(<span class="kwrd">int</span> thePositionY)</pre><pre>        {</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//When the width is greater than 0, the user is selecting an area to the right of the starting point</span></pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (mSelectionBox.Width &gt; 0)</pre><pre class="alt">            {</pre><pre>                <span class="rem">//Draw the line starting at the starting location and moving to the right</span></pre><pre class="alt">                <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> aCounter = 0; aCounter &lt;= mSelectionBox.Width - 10; aCounter += 10)</pre><pre>                {</pre><pre class="alt">                    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (mSelectionBox.Width - aCounter &gt;= 0)</pre><pre>                    {</pre><pre class="alt">                        mSpriteBatch.Draw(mDottedLine, <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(mSelectionBox.X + aCounter, thePositionY, 10, 5), Color.White);</pre><pre>                    }</pre><pre class="alt">                }</pre><pre>            }</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//When the width is less than 0, the user is selecting an area to the left of the starting point</span></pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">else</span> <span class="kwrd">if</span> (mSelectionBox.Width &lt; 0)</pre><pre class="alt">            {</pre><pre>                <span class="rem">//Draw the line starting at the starting location and moving to the left</span></pre><pre class="alt">                <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> aCounter = -10; aCounter &gt;= mSelectionBox.Width; aCounter -= 10)</pre><pre>                {</pre><pre class="alt">                    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (mSelectionBox.Width - aCounter &lt;= 0)</pre><pre>                    {</pre><pre class="alt">                        mSpriteBatch.Draw(mDottedLine, <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(mSelectionBox.X + aCounter, thePositionY, 10, 5), Color.White);</pre><pre>                    }</pre><pre class="alt">                }</pre><pre>            }</pre><pre class="alt">        }</pre></div>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">So we have two cases here. When the Width of the
horizontal line is greater than zero, the player has moved the mouse
pointer from the start position (where they initially left clicked) and
to the right of the screen. This gives the horizontal line a positive
width. The second case is when the player has move the mouse pointer
from the start position and to the left of the screen. this will give
the Width a negative value. Each of those cases need to be handled
separately. For the case of the Width equaling 0, we do not draw the
line.</p>
<p aling="left">When the Width is greater than 0, we loop through from
0 to to the width of the line (minus a slight offset for the Width of
the dotted line texture), incrementing by 10. Then as long as we aren't
wider than the line, we draw the texture over and over again just
moving it further and further to the right each time. This gives us our
<b>dashed horizontal line</b>.</p>
<p aling="left">When the Width is less than 0, we still have a loop and
draw the line in a similar fashion, the difference is that we have to
move down through the loop and moving the image further and further tot
he left as we draw it.</p>
<p aling="left">Now that we have created our method to draw the
Horizontal line, we need to add a call to this method to our Draw
method (and remove our code we were using to draw the image where we
clicked).</p>
<p aling="left">Add the following code to the Draw method:</p>
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw(GameTime gameTime)</pre><pre>        {</pre><pre class="alt">            graphics.GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">// TODO: Add your drawing code here</span></pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//Begin drawing with the batch</span></pre><pre>            mSpriteBatch.Begin();</pre><pre class="alt">            </pre><pre>            <span class="rem">//Draw the horizontal portions of the selection box </span></pre><pre class="alt">            DrawHorizontalLine(mSelectionBox.Y);  </pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//End the drawing with the batch </span></pre><pre>            mSpriteBatch.End();</pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Draw(gameTime);</pre><pre class="alt">        }</pre></div>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">So we removed our old code from the Draw method
(although we still are clearing the screen to Black) and added our call
to DrawHorizontalLine. We want the horizontal line to draw the vertical
position where the player initialize clicked the left mouse button, so
that's why we pass in the value mSelectionBox.Y.</p>
<p aling="left">Well, again, we have done a lot and written quite a bit of new code. Let's take a little break from typing and do a quick <b>build</b> <a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/CropperCapture1335.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-width: 0px;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/CropperCapture133_thumb3.jpg" border="0" width="40" height="36"></a>&nbsp;to make sure that everything compiles ok.</p>
<p aling="left">When you run the game, you should see the black screen
initially. Now when you left click, the horizontal line should begin
drawing and continue to draw in the horizontal direction as you move
your mouse around. Releasing the Left mouse button should remove the
horizontal line.</p>
<p aling="left" align="center"><a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/CropperCapture1412.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border: 0px none ;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/CropperCapture141_thumb.jpg" border="0" width="614" height="480"></a> </p>
<p aling="left">We're getting there! </p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left"><strong><u>Drawing a Vertical line:</u></strong></p>
<p aling="left">To draw our vertical line, we need to track where the
Mouse is moving to in the vertical direction as the player keeps the
left mouse button pressed. This will require us to add some more code
to the Update method.</p>
<p aling="left">Add the following code to the Update method:</p>

<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">There was only one small change to this method. We now
change the height of the selection box while the player keeps the left
button clicked. We do this by taking the current Y position of the
mouse and subtracting the starting Y position from it. This gives us
our Height for the Vertical line.</p>
<p aling="left">Now we need to add a new method to the class for
drawing a Vertical line. This method is fairly similar to the
Horizontal method.</p>
<p aling="left">Add the following method to the class:</p>

<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">Again, we&nbsp;have two cases. When the&nbsp;Height of
the&nbsp;vertical line is greater than zero, the player has moved the
mouse pointer from the start position (where they initially left
clicked) and to the bottom of the screen. This gives the vertical line
a positive height. The second case is when the player has move the
mouse pointer from the start position and to the top of the screen.
this will give the Height a negative value. Each of those cases need to
be handled separately. For the case of the Height equaling 0, we do not
draw the line.</p>
<p aling="left">When the Height is greater than 0, we loop through
from&nbsp;-2 (a&nbsp;slight offset for&nbsp;improving the visual
look)&nbsp;to to the height of the line, incrementing by 10. Then as
long as we aren't higher than the line, we draw the texture over and
over again just moving it further and further to the down each time.
When we do the actual draw call, we have to rotate the dash so that
it's in the vertical position. We do this by giving it a rotation of 90
degrees. This gives us our <b>dashed vertical line</b>.</p>
<p aling="left">When the Height is less than 0, we still have a loop
and draw the line in a similar fashion, the difference is that we have
to move down through the loop and moving the image further and further
to the top as we draw it.</p>
<p aling="left">Now that we have created our method to draw the Vertical line, we need to add a call to this method to our Draw method.</p>
<p aling="left">Add the following code to the Draw method:</p>
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw(GameTime gameTime)</pre><pre>        {</pre><pre class="alt">            graphics.GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">// TODO: Add your drawing code here</span></pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//Begin drawing with the batch</span></pre><pre>            mSpriteBatch.Begin();</pre><pre class="alt">            </pre><pre>            <span class="rem">//Draw the horizontal portions of the selection box </span></pre><pre class="alt">            DrawHorizontalLine(mSelectionBox.Y);  </pre><pre>  </pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//Draw the vertical portions of the selection box </span></pre><pre>            DrawVerticalLine(mSelectionBox.X); </pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>            <span class="rem">//End the drawing with the batch </span></pre><pre class="alt">            mSpriteBatch.End();</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Draw(gameTime);</pre><pre>        }</pre></div>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">Now that we have added our call to DrawVerticalLine
(and we passed in mSelectionBox.X to draw the line at the starting X
location), let again check to make sure we have the vertical line
drawing correctly. Do a quick <b>build</b>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/livewriter/FadeInFadeout_128E0/CropperCapture1335.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-width: 0px;" src="YouHaveBeenSelected_files/CropperCapture133_thumb3.jpg" border="0" width="40" height="36"></a>&nbsp;to test things out.</p>
<p aling="left">When you run the game, you should see the black screen
initially. Now when you left click, the horizontal line should begin
drawing and continue to draw in the horizontal direction as you move
your mouse around. Also, there should now be a vertical line drawing
and continuing to draw in the vertical direction as you mouse your
mouse around. Releasing the Left mouse button should remove the
horizontal and vertical lines.</p>

<p aling="left"><strong><u>Drawing the Selection Box:</u></strong></p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p aling="left">Well, we have a horizontal line and a vertical line
drawing now. We only need two more lines and we will have created our
selection box! To get your selection box drawing in it's entirety, you
just need to add a couple more lines of code to the Draw method.</p>
<p aling="left">Add the following code to the Draw method:</p>
<div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw(GameTime gameTime)</pre><pre>        {</pre><pre class="alt">            graphics.GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">// TODO: Add your drawing code here</span></pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="rem">//Begin drawing with the batch</span></pre><pre>            mSpriteBatch.Begin();</pre><pre class="alt">            </pre><pre>            <span class="rem">//Draw the horizontal portions of the selection box </span></pre><pre class="alt">            DrawHorizontalLine(mSelectionBox.Y);  </pre><pre>            DrawHorizontalLine(mSelectionBox.Y + mSelectionBox.Height); </pre><pre class="alt">  </pre><pre>            <span class="rem">//Draw the vertical portions of the selection box </span></pre><pre class="alt">            DrawVerticalLine(mSelectionBox.X); </pre><pre>            DrawVerticalLine(mSelectionBox.X + mSelectionBox.Width);  </pre><pre class="alt">&nbsp;</pre><pre>            <span class="rem">//End the drawing with the batch </span></pre><pre class="alt">            mSpriteBatch.End();</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Draw(gameTime);</pre><pre>        }</pre></div>
<p aling="left">Two new method calls have been added. We call
DrawHorizontalLine a second time, passing it a new&nbsp;Y position (the
starting Y position + the current Height of the line) to draw the
bottom of the selection box. Then we call DrawVerticalLine a second
time, passing it a new X position (the starting X position + the
current Width of the line). This will complete the sides of our
selection box. </p>
<p aling="left">Go ahead and give the project a final <b>build</b>. You should now see your selection box demo <b>working entirely</b>.
When you left click and drag, a dashed selection box will draw and when
you release the left mouse button, the box will disappear.</p>

<p aling="left"><b>Congratulations!</b> You have completed the selection box tutorial. </p>
<p aling="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Now that you <b>know how to create a selection box</b>,
can you think of some places where you might use it? Making an RTS
(real time strategy) game is an obvious first thought but&nbsp;a pretty
large project, can you think of a smaller game you could make using a
selection box? </p>
<p align="left">You can download the source code&nbsp;for the tutorial from <a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/tutorials/youhavebeenselected/SelectionBox.zip">here</a>. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong><u>One Step Further:</u></strong></p>
<p align="left">I've <b>expanded the project</b> a bit&nbsp;creating
some "units" that you can select and move around the game
window&nbsp;just to make it a little more fun. You can download the
source code for that project <a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/tutorials/youhavebeenselected/SelectionBoxOneStepFurther.zip">here</a>.</p>
