					George is a business developer by day. At night, George likes
					to dabble with game development. With the release of XNA, this
					hobby has become less frustration and changing the colors of
					triangles and more "Wow! Did you make that Dad?"

With XNA Game Studio Express, developers can create games using the XNA
Framework. While developers have always been able to make games, the
XNA Framework has reduced the once steep learning curve for game
development and made it into something more attainable for the masses
of developers who dream of making their own game. All at no cost to the
developer. </p>
			<p> In addition to XNA providing free and less
complicated game development, games developed using XNA Game Studio
Express will be playable on Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360. An opportunity like
this is unprecedented in game development history. Hobbyists have never
before had the chance to play their games on a console without friends
in high places or loads of cash to purchase the expensive console
development software and licenses. </p>
			<p> With more developers being able to create games and
an increase in interest for the chance to be able to show &#8220;their&#8221; game
on the Xbox 360, XNA Development.com was created to provide this new
community with easy to follow tutorials and code samples for game
development. With a strong focus on 2D game development, XNA
Development.com strives to make it possible for everyone to understand
how they can realize their own dream of making a game. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="column right">
			<p> Please do
not think of these tutorials as the &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;best&#8221; way of making a
game. They are simply a stepping stone in the path to creating your own
game. Whether that game is for you, your children, your friend or the
start of your own game company, XNA Development.com wants to be there
to help you through those rough spots. By providing well documented
code and using good development practices whenever possible, XNA
Development hopes to be a quality site in providing that resource you
need to get your game going from start to finish. </p>
