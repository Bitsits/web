this XNA development site (formerly XNA101.com) focuses on XNA
development for game developers without previous C# experience. There
are lots of tutorials, code samples and information on XNA development
for developers of all skill sets. This site is also a great resource
for people wanting to get started with 3D development with XNA.

development. While it's my personal stance that I think you should just
learn C# to use XNA, these tutorials are still a good resource for
people to scared to take the plunge right now (like I was for years).
