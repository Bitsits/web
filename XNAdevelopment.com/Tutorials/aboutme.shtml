George is relatively new to the development scene. He took a short
course in BASIC on Apple IIgs in High School and didn't re-visit the
computer world again until his freshman year of college in 1996. A lot
had changed. </p>
				<p>
George managed to catch up (some) and graduated with a Math/Computer Science major in 2000 from <a href="http://www.gcc.edu/">Grove City College</a>.
He's been employed as a software developer ever since and continues to
refine his development skills and play catch up with all these "old
school" developers. </p>
				<p>
Currently, George is a business developer by day working with C#,
VB.NET, ASP.NET and SQL building WinForm and Web software for the
construction industry at <a href="http://www.viewpointcs.com/">Viewpoint Construction Software</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
At night, George likes to dabble with game development. George even
managed to win a small game development contest using Managed Direct X
with the classic game <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/clingermangw/category/4558.aspx?Show=All">"Bob The Fish"</a>
(surely you've heard of it!). However, with the release of XNA, this
hobby has become less frustration and changing the colors of triangles
and more "Wow! Did you make that Dad?" </p>
				<img src="aboutme_files/MVP_BlueOnly5.png" width="111" height="172">
				<p>
George runs an XNA community site, <a href="http://www.xnadevelopment.com/">XNADevelopment.com</a> where he creates tutorials for beginning 2D game development with XNA and <a href="http://creators.xna.com/search/SearchResults.aspx?u=2249&amp;o=DateDescending">tries to help out</a>
the best he can in the official Microsoft Creators Club forums for XNA.
For this work (and most likely because of some internal accidental
mix-up) George was awarded a <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=566A8AD3-8E8B-422F-99E4-8DED2A870C62">Microsoft MVP award for XNA</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
Since the launch of his site in August 2006, George has been involved in a variety of random XNA community events.

				<p>
George was lucky enough to meet up with <a href="http://www.neopoleon.com/">Rory Blyth</a> at the XNA Game Studio Express launch and get his mug in a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=267098">Channel 9 video</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
George was also <a href="http://www.xnatutorial.com/?p=52">interviewed by Joran Omark</a> (we miss your XNA community updates!) at his wonderful site <a href="http://www.xnatutorial.com/">XNATutorial.com</a> where George may have written just a bit <a href="http://www.xnatutorial.com/?p=53">too much about himself</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
George has also started branching out and you can find <a href="http://pdx.techevents.info/codecamp/3/PresenterInfo.aspx?ID=578be36a-0e90-46d1-964f-fcfc69118ce6">him speaking</a> at the local Code Camps in the Northwest.
				</p>
				<p>
George also tries to regularly frequent the official XNA IRC channel (<a href="irc://irc.efnet.net/#xna">EFnet #xna</a>) and try to pretend like he knows what he's talking about when someone has a question.
				</p>
				<p>
When not writing tutorials for XNADevelopment.com, you can keep up with what George is doing and thinking about by checking out <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/clingermangw/Default.aspx">his blog</a> that he has maintained for years now at the <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/">GeeksWithBlogs</a> blogging community.
				</p>
				<p>
George feels a bit weird about writing about himself in the third person, but <a href="http://www.mylittlescraps.com/blog">his lovely wife and four wonderful sons</a> have assured him that it sounds ok.
