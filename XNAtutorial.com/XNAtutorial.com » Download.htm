			<p>Excellent
tutorials not only covering XNA but also some extremely important
fundamentals on the C# language that everybody will be coding their XNA
games in. I would imagine there will be just as many people new to C#
and programming in general as there are experienced programmers who are
just new to XNA and game programming.</p>
<p>Here’s food for though though. Of all the beginner tutorials I see
on XNA game programming, the majority of them approach their objectives
of teaching people how to code games from quite an unsound point…that
is, starting to write code straight away.</p>
<p>I’m a relatively new programmer too and EVERY book I see keeps
telling me how important it is to first use established practices for
planning your approach to creating a program before your fingers even
touch the keyboard. Presumably this topic is covered by books on
Object-Oriented Analysis and Object-Ooriented Design?</p>
<p>Now when an author is presenting small bite-size examples of code
purely for demonmstrating language syntax and various elements, such as
this series of tutorials does, then there is probably no need for
initial planning discussions because the code samples are fairly
trivial and stand-alone, making them easy to visualise even fior
beginners.</p>
<p>However, programming a game is no easy task and yet all beginner
tutorials that discuss actual game coding and present extenisve code to
type in (including the Game Starter Kits themselves), completely
neglect to discuss the planning stages beforehand. I often find myself
asking questions such as </p>
<p>“Why did the author decide on the structure of the collection of classes the game uses?”</p>
<p>“How did they decide on their design of data structures?”</p>
<p>“How did they come up with their algorithms?”</p>
<p>“How do I envisage the game program flow and design the game classes based on this knowledge?”</p>
<p>It seems beginners are thus required to learn about good program
design and planning principles purely by having to reverse-engineer the
author’s design decisions from the code itself.</p>
<p>Surely there’s a need for tutorial authors to begin covering
important steps and techniques they used in designing the programs they
present in their tutorials as part of the tutorial itself?</p>
<p>Something to think about at least <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>Kudos to Joran for his approach to these tutorials ,as he explains
some important concepts as to they why’s of coding as well as the
how’s. Can’t wait to se emore of his work and, maybe, even coverage on
good techniques for program design and planning <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"></p>

“Excellent tutorials not only covering XNA but also some extremely
important fundamentals on the C# language that everybody will be coding
their XNA games in. I would imagine there will be just as many people
new to C# and programming in general as there are experienced
programmers who are just new to XNA and game programming.”</p>
<p>Knowing how to program C# is more important, so for me XNA is secondary - XNA is just a tool to learn to program in a fun way.</p>
<p>I chose XNA because I believe that by the time I am finished, two
three years from now, professional studios will use managed languages
and managed frameworks. The overhead for using C# compared to a managed
wrapper around C++ (be that C++/CLI or your own wrapper) is already
negligible, and will be even more so three years from now.</p>
<p>Quake III was the last game idSoftware wrote in C. After that, games
became too complex, so not even Carmack could handle it. The Doom III
engine was done in C++, because it was so complex that only object
oriented programming made them possible. Note the differences when
interacting with your environment in Quake III and Doom III for an
example.</p>
<p>Blizzard, arguably the greatest game house out there, have been
using object oriented programming for a long time. Starcraft, Diablo,
Warcraft III and World of Warcraft were all done in C++, solely for its
object orientation.</p>
<p>But, C++ was not designed for object oriented programming. It was added later, and now the language is a bit messy to code in.</p>
<p>I’m betting that the next step is to move to a language which was
designed from the ground up for object oriented programming. I’m also
saying that managed code makes your framerate drop from 60 FPS to 58.
Considering the benefits, that’s worth it already today. Five years
from now, it will rule the game development houses.</p>
<p>XNA is managed C#, managed DirectX, and managed .Net. C# JIT compiles to optimize for your computer.</p>
<p>Not only am I digressing, I’m rambling too… (c: Back to the point.</p>
<p>darrenecm: “Here’s food for though though. Of all the beginner

keyboard. Presumably this topic is covered by books on Object-Oriented
Analysis and Object-Oriented Design?”</p>
<p>I agree with you. There is one other consideration I’d like to add,
though. My series starts with installing programs, next teaching the
basics of what computer code is, and then introducing what object
oriented programming is. All this takes about an hour. Not until after
explaining what OOP is, could I jump to design. But I don’t.</p>
<p>People switch channel on their TVs roughly fifteen million times per
hour. (c: Arguably, these videos don’t compare to channel surfing, but
still, people have short attention spans. If I wouldn’t at least
display a box on screen within the two first hours of videos, nobody
would keep watching.</p>
<p>darrenecm: “However, programming a game is no easy task and yet all
beginner tutorials that discuss actual game coding and present
extensive code to type in (including the Game Starter Kits themselves),
completely neglect to discuss the planning stages beforehand.”</p>
<p>I still agree with you. (c: I want to do what you are saying, but
feel that I would lose people. The compromise I’m making is that there
will be a few things happening on screen first, such as a mouse cursor
and possibly an animation. After that, I’ll take the time to draw up
some design charts, explaining where this is going, and why.</p>
<p>darrenecm: “I often find myself asking questions such as </p>
<p>‘Why did the author decide on the structure of the collection of classes the game uses?’</p>
<p>‘How did they decide on their design of data structures?’</p>
<p>‘How did they come up with their algorithms?’</p>
<p>‘How do I envisage the game program flow and design the game classes based on this knowledge?’”</p>
<p>These are good questions. I’ll make note of them, and bring them up as soon as possible. Thank you!</p>

			<p>Oh, I’d like to add one more thing. I haven’t made any design decisions yet. (c:</p>

			<p>I agree whole-heartedly with darrenecm. </p>
<p>Fantastic tutorials, Joran! I am very impressed with your
introduction to the XNA framework via Object Oriented Programming and
encapsulation. It’s such a relief to see some video tutorials that take
the time to set up code properly, instead of rushing in and putting all
the game code into one class (which a lot of tutorials on the internet
seem to encourage).</p>
<p>I am just a hobbyist programmer, so I didn’t really know much about
how code should be written to flow together and how to encapsulate it.
I’d been looking for examples of how to write my code to act as a
reusable ‘game engine’, much like Popcap’s SexyApp Framework
(developer.popcap.com). And I think that your video tutorials are the
answer! <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>I applaud you for your efforts, and I will eagerly be awaiting future developments in the tutorial series. <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>

			<p>Well
I have to agree with darrenecm on most of what he says and Joran I
understand what your saying about people not watching. However, I think
that it would be a good idea for a video on design of an game without
any coding. I think maybe it would make more sense that it come later
in the series though so that people will watch it. Get all the cool
stuff out of the way and then bring up the design. By the time most
people get through the series I think they would be ready for a little
boring, but useful design theory.</p>
<p>One of the most overlook things in programming tutorials is design.
After many years in programming and having to hire new programmers, I
found a major flaw nearly *all* of them have is no training in design.
Most just sit down and start coding. Now if your the only programmer or
maybe there is one other programmer that can be ok to do. However, when
you work on a team of 7 or 20 or whatever #, the design part of
developing *any* program becomes very important and something that
seems to be missed over.</p>

			<p>Just
downloaded the 4th pack lessons 11-15 and can’t wait to see them. I
have poked around trying to learn coding for games for a few years but
trying to DIY with a copy of SAMS Learn it in 21 Days just didn’t cut
it. Your video tutorials and your own beginner status has reinspired me
to try alot harder with easier tools. </p>
<p>In response to the comments above, I have to agree that managed (ala
modular) code is definately the way developers are headed. This is a
great time to pick up the new technology if anyone has plans for
working with some of the developers (or for themselves).</p>
<p>I also agree that having a head for design is critical. Without a
plan for development a person can sit spinning their wheels for
eternity if they don’t fall out from discouragement. Let me drop in a
little “general planner” that hopefully might help a bit.</p>
<p>THE DEVELOPMENT CYCLE</p>
<p>Concept:<br>
&gt; Sketch out game screen activity ideas<br>
&gt; Define expected A.I. behavior<br>
&gt; Create basic game asset (GUI, models, music, etc.) prototypes</p>
<p>Design:<br>
&gt; Collaborate with entire design team<br>
&gt; Layout a storyboard approach with asset placement<br>
&gt; Incorporate visual expectations</p>
<p>Development:<br>
&gt; Integrate GUI to game engine<br>
&gt; Incorporate runtime A.I. behavior<br>
&gt; Incorporate all game assets</p>
<p>Testing:<br>
&gt; Debug asset behavior thru gameplay<br>
&gt; Test remore connectivity<br>
&gt; Use Beta player testing</p>
<p>Release:<br>
&gt; Resolve release format (PC or xBox or both)<br>
&gt; Check for any copyright infringements<br>
&gt; Select distribution sources</p>
<p>Support:<br>
&gt; Provide support website &amp; forums<br>
&gt; Accept input from fan base<br>
&gt; Resolve software/hardware conflicts</p>
<p>… and that’s it.</p>
<p>Alot for any do it yourselfer but that’s why work like Joran’s and
others in the community is so important. They help to provide vital
tools, the bulk of which is basic knowledge. So, thanks for your
efforts and keep up the good work.</p>

			<p>I appreciate your effort.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>Why do you call this an XNA tutorial? So far I have gone through
four tutorials and all you have produced is one sprite on the screen.
This information is available MSDN. I would of preferred if you spent
less time telling me what a variable is and more on how to use XNA.</p>
<p>I mean there are plenty of resources out there on the net telling
people what namespaces, using directives, variables, statements and
expressions are and not many showing you how to use XNA.</p>
<p>Why dont you write a camera component or a terrain component or something useful!</p>

			<p>Gruddo: “Why do you call this an XNA tutorial?”</p>
<p>To answer your question: it will be about XNA.</p>
<p>Gruddo: “So far I have gone through four tutorials and all you have produced is one sprite on the screen.”</p>
<p>Yes, I agree, so far. However, I’m in this for the long run. This
means that when there are forty packs up here, a year from now, then
you’ll see that there’s plenty of stuff about XNA in there.</p>
<p>There was an earlier effort, which got a bit further, using XNA beta
1. But because of the changes in the framework, I decided to start
over. Sorry, but what with Chrismas and real life, it’s not going as
fast as some would like.</p>
<p>Seeing as how good you are with programming already, maybe you would
find the old series more useful, as they do a bit more. I’ll add links
to them below the packs at the top of this page as soon as I finish
writing this comment.</p>
<p>Gruddo: “I mean there are plenty of resources out there on the net
telling people what namespaces, using directives, variables, statements
and expressions are”</p>
<p>Yes, there are plenty of those. There are none of them which are
fun, though. Mine is fun, because it teaches programming using XNA
instead of a ‘customer retention software solution’ or some other
sleeping pill.</p>
<p>Gruddo: “This information is available MSDN. I would of preferred if
you spent less time telling me what a variable is and more on how to
use XNA.”</p>
<p>You seem like you know what you’re doing. What are you doing over
here then? Let me quote myself: “XNAtutorial.com provides video
instructions for beginners wanting to get into game programming.”</p>
<p>The point I’m trying to make is that this site is for beginners, not
for Gruddo, because he should be helping me out instead of the other
way arouund. (c:</p>
<p>Gruddo: “Why dont you write a camera component or a terrain component or something useful!”</p>
<p>I will. This game will have a camera component eventually. But since
I’m starting from the beginnig, there are some things which need to be
explained first. The camera component is on it’s way as well, but much
further up the stream.</p>
<p>Gruddo: “I appreciate your effort.”</p>
<p>I hope that didn’t come out wrong. I’m in no way thinking you’re
considering me doing something wrong, just that this site is not for
you - you’re too good, Grasshopper. (c:</p>

			<p>Ken, thank you for that schedule, and thank you for putting in the effort to type it up!</p>
<p>It is a good summary. I especially like how you give equal spacing
to both development and post-development acitivities - a lot of people
seem to thinkn they are done some they can play the game on their own
machine.</p>
<p>They don’t even realize that for a small indie title the start menus
and configuration options may take as long as the actual game they wrap
around…. But I digress, as usual.</p>
<p>I’ll definitely incorporate something similar in the tutorials, much borrowed from your great outline.</p>
<p>Thanks, and cheers!<br>

			<p>Oh,
one more thing. For those of you, like Gruddo, who are only interested
in half of the subject I’m getting into, learn to read the keywords
‘theory’ and ‘practice’.</p>
<p>Videos labeled ‘theory’ are goin to be mostly about the C# language.</p>
<p>In videos labeled ‘practice’, I’ll try to stick to only XNA.</p>

			<p>I just bought two great books on the aspects of object-oriented program design and planning called:</p>
<p>‘The Object Oriented Thought Process’ by Matt Weisfeld and published by Developor’s Library.</p>
<p>‘Code Complete’ (2nd edition) by Steve McConnel and published by Microsoft Press.</p>
<p>If, like me, you don’t have a formal education in object-oriented
programming, you will find these two books invaluable to better
understanding how to analyse design object-oriented programs before you
put fingers to keyboard.</p>
<p>Weisfeld’s book is for newcomers and covers the fundamentals
brilliantly. Code Complete is the next step up to furthering your
knowledge and contains some truly brilliant insights into good coding
practices and program architecture and design.</p>

<p>Stefan: “I guess your Microsoft’s MVP for XNA is on the way…”</p>
<p>Not that important to me, but it would be fun. I don’t consider myself having done enough, though, but maybe 2008.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are plenty of people more deserving, which should be nominated before me:</p>
<p>- Gregory Wurm for LearnXNA.com and video tutorials.</p>
<p>- Mark Coffman for Xbox360Homebrew.com and audio tutorials.</p>
<p>- The Jaegers for XNAresources.com and tile tutorials.</p>
<p>- Derek Nedelman for ThreeSixBox.com and 3D tutorials.</p>
<p>- George Clingerman XNAdevelopment.com, state tutorials, and being active on the MSDN forums.</p>
<p>- Bill Reiss for xna101.net and a long series of tutorials.</p>
<p>- Glenn Wilson for virtualrealm.com.au, tutorials, and being active on the MSDN forums.</p>
<p>- Michael Morton for ZiggyWare.com and a million tutorials.</p>
<p>Some of these are already MVPs in other cateogries, but I’ve already
emailed the MVP team about many of these people, and I suggest you do
the same with your favorites. They should get the MVP award before me.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br>

			<p>I
just finished watching Tutorial Pack 5 and things get better and
clearer with each tutorial release. I’m certainly grasping lots of
things much faster thanks to Joran’s videos than I do from most
commercial books on game programming.</p>
<p>Big thanks to Joran for his continuing work on these tuts.</p>
<p>In keeping with my previous comments above on recommending really
cool programming books to enhance understanding of concepts that Joran
covers in his videos, might I also suggest the following book to
everyone, which arrived today courtesy of my friendly neighbourhood
Amazon.co.uk courier:</p>
<p>‘Game Architecture and Design - A New Edition’, by Andrew Rollins &amp; Dave Morris and published by New Riders.</p>
<p>This 900-plus pahe chunky tome has LOTS of very good tips and topics
on how object-oriented games are structured - which I would imagine
will further enhance everyone’s understanding of Joran’s tutorials.
There’s a particularly interesting and thorough explanation on how game
loop timing works, which should help everyone understand the importance
of the GameTime concepts that XNA features, and which Joran covered
nicely in Tutorial Pack 5 <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"></p>

			<p>Jöran,</p>
<p>Let me start by saying, excellent videos. Great job on them.. I have
been programming in many languages but never in any game type
situations.</p>
<p>I am a newbie to C#. Listening and seeing your videos are a great start. I have some questions though!</p>
<p>1. When do you know what types of commands you shopuld be using in
order to get a task done? Meaning, I want to have c# load my background
for the game and display on the screen. Take this in babby steps.</p>
<p>2. Using all these new methods. Is there a list of all of them in
alphibetical order? I looked on the website and in my books and in the
help files for c#, but it is either very hard to understand that 10
things are happening in one statement and what are the actually parts
that are what a programer chooses to name something vers the built in
commands?</p>
<p>This seems to be the point at which I am stuck at. Know what to use and what the syntax is.</p>
<p>Is it possible to get a 3d game for download fully functionable to
look at and make changes to? I ould like to take steps to see how each
methid can be used. How do you know if your going to need to use an int
or sttring or something? What keys you in when you say ok my game is
going to do this this and this?</p>
<p>It just seems to get very over whelming at times. Not as strange
forward as programing a windows application or database where you can
make some code show you on screen what you are tring to accomplish.</p>
<p>Ok any help is greatly appreciated. Take care.</p>
<p>P.S. What is the best way and product to understand how to draw and
use 3d graphics for charaters and the tools. And once you get the
drawing how do you import or export to c#? See so many questions?</p>

			<p class="metadate">on December 24th, 2006 at 2:24 am</p>

			<p>Hope I understand your questions correctly - I’ve rewritten them as I understand them.</p>
<p>Nick: “‘How do you know what commands to use?”</p>
<p>1. I come up with an idea of what I want to accomplish.<br>
2. I abstract the idea into a general class - trying to understand the big picture.<br>
3. I determine a few key words to describe the class, very much like when searching in Google.<br>
4. I search MSDN for a class which does what I want.<br>
5. I go up through the namespaces to find what I’m looking for.<br>
6. If there is no class, I go to Google and search again.</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p>1. Idea: “I need a per-pixel collision detection method.”<br>
2. Big picture: “This might be available in a sprite class.”<br>
3. Search string: “sprite collision”<br>
4. MSDN returns: A bounding box class, which has a method called
Intersects(). It does pretty much what I want, except it is not
pixel-perfect.<br>
5. I click on the namespace which contains the bounding box. Here I
find that there is a bounding box and a bounding sphere, but nothing
about a pixel-perfect, bounding polygon.<br>
6. I search for “XNA pixel collision detection” over at Google. Google returns <a href="http://www.ziggyware.com/" rel="nofollow">ziggyware.com</a>’s excellent tutorials.</p>
<p>Nick: “How do I load and display a background?”</p>
<p>1. I would go to a very basic tutorial, such as the one included in XNA as ‘You First Game’.<br>
2. I would read it through, and understand what it does, and why.<br>
3. If necessary, I look up every method in MSDN.<br>
4. I know what methods I don’t need to look up in the MSDN help system,
because the are declared in the little sample I have in front of me.<br>
5. When I do understand the whole sample, it is easy to modify it to use a bigger texture, and cover the entire background.</p>
<p>Nick: “Is there a list of all methods in alphabetical order?”</p>
<p>1. The MSDN help system does a pretty good job at this.<br>
2. If you don’t like that, maybe <a href="http://www.aisto.com/Roeder/DotNet/" rel="nofollow">Reflector</a> is for you.</p>
<p>Nick: “How do I find out which are the programmer’s variables and methods, and which are part of the framework?”</p>
<p>1. I place my caret on top of the method name, and hit F12.<br>
2. Then Visual C# takes me to the place where it was defined, if it was made by the programmer.<br>
3. If such a place doesn’t exist, the method must have been part of XNA/.NET. So, I hit F1 instead.<br>
4. Then Visual C# fires up the MSDN help system, and takes me to it’s help section.</p>
<p>Nick: “Is there an XNA 3D game with full source available?”</p>
<p>1. If you want to have you hand held all the way, maybe Bill Reiss’s xna101.net or Riemer Grootjans’ riemers.net is for you.<br>
2. If you just want to play with something finished, maybe Johnny Lightbulb’s <a href="http://xbox360homebrew.com/blogs/johnnylightbulb/archive/2006/12/09/1607.aspx" rel="nofollow">Strange Things</a> suits you better.</p>
<p>Nick: “How do you know when to use an int, and when a float?”</p>
<p>If I am to store something which will only use integers, I use an integer, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Basically, it is the same thing as if you do something on paper. If
I am to design a house, and I need to calculate how thick to make the
bearing wall, I wouldn’t strip the decimals off of the result I get on
the calculator.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I count sheep at night, I don’t count one-point-oh, two-point-oh, etc.</p>
<p>As for using a float or a double - in the beginning, just use
whatever you feel like. Eventually, you will go back and read up on the
details, and by then other things will be so clear that you understand
right away.</p>
<p>Nick: “Which 3D modeling program is easiest to use/learn and makes me understand 3D?”</p>
<p>I’d say that Blender is the one to use. It’s not super-easy to figure out, but do visit <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/bvidtute/" rel="nofollow">Greybeard’s video tutorials</a> site, and you can figure it out:</p>
<p>Blender does give you one great benefit - it is written directly on
top of OpenGL. Because of this, you will learn a lot about local space,
global space, shaders, and so on. This will transfer right over to
programming later on.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Holiday cheers!<br>
Joran</p>

<p>Abi just released Rocket Commander in an XNA version:</p>
<p><a href="http://exdream.no-ip.info/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=442152d0-a014-47de-b9b1-4e8aed1d9bd3" rel="nofollow">http://exdream.no-ip.info/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=442152d0-a014-47de-b9b1-4e8aed1d9bd3</a></p>
<p>It’s one of the best resources out there, because it comes with a
bunch of video tutorials to explain the code, albeit the old pre-XNA
code:</p>

Mr. Jöran for your wonderful tutorials …I think you are the first
person who makes VTM’s as a full series - with your video’s I learn XNA
much faster ..and it’s fun…it will also be cool if you can create a
series on 3d graphics for Windows ..with<br>
I don’t know…loading a character, controlling i,t give it physic
properties this kind of stuff. Once again congratulations &gt;:D</p>

			<p>I started out using CamStudio, which is a free SourceForge project.</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/camstudio/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/camstudio/</a></p>
<p>It was great, just click record, and off you were. However, some
people reported that the videos lost audio-video syncronization after a
while, so I quit using it.</p>
<p>Instead, I invested in Camtasia, which is, as far as I know, the
only solution worthy of your money. It is a complete package, both for
recording and editing. I have version three, but there is a version
four out in a trial version, which I’m considering upgrading to.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp</a></p>
<p>If you have the time, download both CamStudio and Camtasia, and look
at the similarities. I think somebody was studying the source code a
bit too much…</p>
<p>Cheers!<br>

			<p>Hi again Joran…<br>
I very much enjoyed your your explaination of stack &amp; heap memory…
it leads me to a question about the image class in video 17: </p>
<p>If I understand correctly, the declarations as below set up variables on the stack? </p>
<p>private SpriteBatch spriteBatch;<br>
private Texture2D texture;<br>
private Vector2 position;<br>
private Rectangle source;<br>
private Color color;<br>
private float rotation;<br>
private Vector2 origin;<br>
private Vector2 scale;<br>
private SpriteEffects effects;<br>
private float layer; </p>
<p>further down the code, I believe the objects themselves are created on the heap &amp; linked to the stack variables? </p>
<p>this.position = new Vector2(100, 100);<br>
this.source = new Rectangle(0, 0, 128, 128);<br>
this.color = Color.White;<br>
this.rotation = 0f;<br>
this.origin = new Vector2(source.Width/2, source.Height/2);<br>
this.scale = Vector2.One;<br>
this.effects = SpriteEffects.None;<br>
this.layer = 0.5f; </p>
<p>My Question:<br>
When the “new” keyword is NOT used, is it because a class parameter is
invoked, thereby creating the object without he need for “new”?<br>
i.e<br>
position is a vector2 type, created with “new”<br>
scale is also a vector2 type, but “new” not used</p>
<p>Thanks again for a great set of learning aids<br>

			<p>Chris Johnson:<br>
on the stack?<br>
private SpriteBatch;<br>
private float rotation;</p>
<p>Joran:<br>
Sounds about right. The stack only holds the 32 bit “page number” of where on the heap there will be a SpriteBatch later on.</p>
<p>However, the rotation floating point number is so small, that it fits straight on the stack.</p>
<p>Chris Johnson:<br>
the objects themselves are created on the heap &amp; linked to the stack variables?</p>
<p>Joran:<br>
The heap contains objects, because they are too big to fit on the
stack. So, that sounds pretty good, that the SpriteBatch lives on the
heap, with a page number on the stack. The variable rotation stores the
value straight on the stack, and never uses the heap.</p>
<p>Chris Johnson:<br>
this.position = new Vector2(100, 100);<br>
this.scale = Vector2.One;</p>
<p>Joran:<br>
Well, position = new Vector() first fills the heap with a vector, then calls the constructor, passing it 100, 100.</p>
<p>On the other hand, scale = vector2.one uses the code already packed
up and placed on the heap, as a separate object. It calls the One
property accessor method. The code inside looks something like this
(simplified):</p>
<p>static Vector2 One { get { return new Vector(1, 1); } }</p>
<p>Any static method is instantiated and placed on the heap when the game starts up.</p>
<p>I hope I understood your question. Ask again otherwise. I really ought to get that forum finished…</p>
<p>Cheers!<br>
Joran</p>

			<p>Hi, just want to say thanks for the great tutorials, especially for taking time to explain everything in the theory lessons.</p>
<p>I started programming by teaching myself Java about six months ago
and now switched to C# to use XNA and since I started programming there
has been a lot of thing that were unclear to me and your tutorials have
cleared a lot of that up as well as teach me new things and programming
techniques that I never even thought about before.<br>
So, thanks again.</p>

<p>I’ve run into a bit of a problem though, on the 13th video where you
write the path to the image you want to show up, Visual C# express says
that it cannot find the file. The code mirrors yours exactly (except
for the image name) and I’ve done everything else fine too. It compiles
without any problem but this. Help please?</p>
<p>I wasn’t really sure where to go for help, but I don’t like that
something that should be really minor is holding me up. Sorry if this
is a problem…</p>

			<p>(a) Did you “Add Existing…” your new image?</p>
<p>(b) Or did you just change the asset name in the LoadGraphicsContent method?</p>
<p>If you did (b), you need to do (a). The Content Pipeline will
process the image you add when you push it through “Add Existing…”,
even changing it from a gif or jpeg to a native XNA format.</p>
<p>If you did (a), I’d like you to flesh out your description of “I’ve
done everything else fine too”, unless someone else chimes in with an
idea.</p>

<p>It is nice to see someone who takes their time and actually explain
all the expresions and consepts you use, and dont leave anything
behind. (Although you make us viewers lazy <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"> )</p>
<p>Cant wait for the next release..</p>

			<p>Yup, I’ve done just as your video directed.</p>
<p>By doing everything else fine, I meant that up to this point, I’ve
had absolutely no problems or unexpected errors or anything like that.</p>
<p>Has the syntax changed at all since that video release or anything? I’m really clueless as to what could be the problem…</p>
<p>I’ve just noticed that after starting the debug, I am not able to
open the image from the solution explorer, instead I get a message box
telling me that the parameters are incorrect. Before starting the
debug, I’m able to open it. ???</p>

<p>Did you set it to “Copy Always”?</p>

			<p>I
have to say, these are by far the best and most thorough tutorials I’ve
see, For example: Where other people fail, and just do the
encapsulation, you tell us why bother with it, why it’s better and more
clean. I’ve been programming C# in one year. But when I saw you videos
i learnt a LOT! Thank you, I love the way you build up these videoes.
especially the vocbulart bits, it’s realy inportant to understand what
you’re doing later.<br>
Keep it coming! Morten</p>

			<p>Yes, I will start releasing again in February.</p>
<p>I’ve my family visiting from Sweden right now. As it is, all my time off form work goes to sightseeing and catching up.</p>
<p>The last of my family, my parents, fly home beginning of February. Then I’ll get time to turn the new code into videos.</p>
<p>I am programming ahead rigth now, and I’ve got a player sprite controlled by mouse and keyboard jumping around at the moment.</p>
<p>During the week that comes, when my parents are off on some
adventure of their own, I’ll add some enemies to shoot at. And actually
shooting at them.</p>
<p>But turning all of that into videos takes time as well. Back in
November, before general Chrimstmas craziness ensued, I put out about a
video per week. I expect that schedule to resume, unless they throw
more work at me.</p>
<p>So, in essence, expect more videos during February.</p>

			<p>Just
posting to thank Joran for these tutorials. They really are the best
tutorials on the web as far as I’m concerned. Unlike all the other
people out there, you actually explain *how* and *why* to do things,
whereas most tutorials just say “Hey, we’re gonna make pong. Copy and
paste all this code, and pretend you’re learning something!” </p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

			<p>Hello Mr. Joran .</p>
<p>I vary much appreciate your hard work, time, and dedication. Your
providing an easy going method to learning game programming in C# -
XNA. I’ve dabbled with tutorials for game programming, but as a novice,
many tutorials are still to complicated for a beginner. Your tutorial
series on video are the best anywhere online. I’ve went though all 30
of them and waiting patiently for new releases. I’m grateful for the
service and knowledge you’ve provide us with. I’m now really learning
how to program a game, and my 9 year old son can’t wait to play it.
This is far better than coding html-asp WebPages I’m use to doing.</p>
<p>Thank You.<br>
Richard<br>
Glendale,AZ</p>

			<p>Hello Joran,</p>
<p> I thought that the videos were really helpful, they helped me learn
basic concepts and idea’s fairly easily. If there was some visual
representation of what is going on then it would make it sick a bit
better. Other than that, these tuturials are the best on the net.</p>

<p>I’d be happy to oblige, but you’ll have to specify a bit what you
mean with (a) “visual representation” and (b) “what is going on”.</p>
<p>(a) I thought that the fact that it was a video was a visual representation. (c:</p>

			<p>Mr.Joran</p>
<p>I have A problem. Being totally new to C# and XNA GSE,<br>
I can’t seem to get the GameState into my head - ( Its dark and scary
in there. lol ). I need a start to finish detailed how to for dummies
on this. See, I would like to click the startup.icon The game opens in
to a Splash screen for 4 seconds. kill the splash screen and go to a
menu screen to set options like screen res, keyboard key layout,sound
options, player options. once set by user. they can chose to play one
of many map levels they want. The only tutorials on making levels and
menus require GameState. but the tutorials are for people that have
lots of programming experience, years. I have a few weeks of it. HELP…</p>
<p>Please<br>

			<p>Wow..</p>
<p>These are the most helpful tutorials I have seen in a very long
time. Everything is step by step and very organized. I have just
finished pack 6 and things are starting to come together now.<br>
I still have to go back and review some more; there is so much content in these things!</p>
<p>The videos help a ton when compared to the boring text tutorials you
see everywhere. Plus most of them do not give as good an explanation as
you.</p>
<p>The only part that I am getting somewhat confused on is keeping
track of all the labels and whatnot: especially the ones like:
spriteBatch &amp; SpriteBatch. Would it be bad practice to rename this
to something more distinguished simply for a newbie like myself to keep
things straight? </p>
<p>Anywho..good work. I see there haven’t been any comments in a while,
which is disappointing, however I hope to see more great tutorials from
you!</p>

			<p>I
have to agree that some parts are a little confusing. I’m not sure if
its the wording used, or if I’m still struggling to learn the concepts.
I’ve gotten used to the different labels (Camel Case and Pascal Case)
however.</p>
<p>For instance it took me a while to realize exactly how the
statements worked when they passed parameters to a method that it
called.</p>
<p>You do some wonderful illustrations with your red pen tool…perhaps
one would be handy when explaining that concept. On second thought, you
do mention it in one of the early chapters…maybe its just me.</p>
<p>One thing that is still a little fuzzy for me is the Initialize and
the Constructor methods. I am not sure when or what to put in there
unless I’m following along with your video.</p>

“The only part that I am getting somewhat confused on is keeping track
of all the labels and whatnot: especially the ones like: spriteBatch
&amp; SpriteBatch. Would it be bad practice to rename this to something
more distinguished simply for a newbie like myself to keep things
straight?”</p>
<p>ArcaneDreams: “I have to agree that some parts are a little
confusing… For instance it took me a while to realize exactly how the
statements worked when they passed parameters to a method that it
called.</p>
<p>ArcaneDreams: “One thing that is still a little fuzzy for me is the
Initialize and the Constructor methods. I am not sure when or what to
put in there unless I’m following along with your video.”</p>
<p>Thank you for your good questions!</p>
<p>As I see it, there are three distinct topics:</p>
<p>1) Naming Conventions.<br>
2) Passing data to and from methods.<br>
3) Purpose of the setting-up methods.</p>
<p>1) Naming conventions are not mandatory. While you write your code,
you can name your variables anything you want. I’m just trying to use
the recommended conventions, although I’ve not studied them in detail,
so I’m probably messing them up. (c:</p>
<p>I will put some thought into the possibility of making an extra
video with some clarifications on my choice of names. It’s not at the
highest priority level for me, though.</p>
<p>2) I’m aware that I botched some of the explanation of passing data.
I’ll try to remedy this as soon as possible. This one has a higher
priority.</p>
<p>3) The constructor instantiates objects. Initialize() sets the
initial values of variables. But, that’s just a rule of thumb I’m
using. I’ve seen people mix and match.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br>
Joran</p>

			<p>Thanks
for the reply! I have pretty much worked out the naming conventions, it
just takes some getting used to. The “Find all references” function is
a great help. Plus I also realize the need to use standard conventions
so that other people may help if necessary. I have looked at quite a
few other tutorials with source code for download, and I must say that
their structure was a lot messier and harder to follow than yours.</p>
<p>In making a large project however, there are so many times you pass
information around…calling methods from here and there, it can be
difficult to keep them straight. I’m thinking about starting a sort of
web outline type thing to visually show how things are working. <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"></p>

<p>UML would be nice, but programs which handle C# cost about the same

<p>I checked the CRC after uploading, but it was fine for me. However,

a much clearer understanding of programming and learned more than I
have during 6 months at University!! I can just imagine the immense
effort that goes into creating these videos. Thanks, you’re a lifesaver

<p>I very much enjoy watching and doing the tutorials, i had some
previous programming expierence in basic from long ago, however your
explanation of classes and their use was very nice, along with the
aspect of making something graphical instead of a boring drop down menu

			<p>Thank you all for your encouraging thoughts! It does motivate.</p>
<p>I’d like to start by apologizing. I’m in a bit of a bind with work
right now, which has taken much more time than anticipated. I’m sorry
that my previous estimates of when I’ll be able to return to
XnaTutorial.com have been so short. But, I promise I’ll get back to
XnaTutorial.com.</p>
<p>When? I have two work-related projects to finish up, which will carry me into next month.</p>
<p>I have written the code and outlined the speech for the coming
packs. I just haven’t found the time to shoot and edit them yet. Just
wanted all of you to know that progress is being made.</p>
<p>Coming up:</p>
<p>First, I’ll introduce GameComponents, including procedurally generating textures. At least a tiny texture.</p>
<p>Next, the Game Object (sprites, triggers, etc) in an inheritance-based design. This will include an XML level file.</p>
<p>Then, a component-based redesign of the Game Object, to show you
where the professional game developers are heading. Inheritance is so
1990s… (c:</p>
<p>That should take a few video packs to wrap up.</p>
<p>Since much of my time has been away from my development machine, I
only have access to my lousy old laptop. From the previous millennium…
This means text is easier for me while I finish up work, so I will
probably have an article in the upcoming XNA magazine.</p>

			<p>Joran,</p>
<p>I have a question about your Singleton, both in the theory video and
the farseer singleton video. You explain each line of code quite
clearly, except you seem to skip the line right after the constructor,
and I’m confused about what it’s doing there. </p>
<p>public sealed class Farseer {<br>
    private static readonly PhysicsSimulator physics = new PhysicsSimulator(new Vector2(0f, 300f));</p>
<p>    private static Farseer() { }</p>
<p>    Farseer() { }  /* What’s this line for? */</p>
<p>    public static PhysicsSimulator Physics {<br>
        get { return physics; }<br>
    }<br>
}<br>
Probably something obvious I’m missing, but I couldn’t figure it out watching the videos again.</p>
<p>Also wanted to say, great tutorials! I’ve never seen such a good mix
of theory and practice, and practically everything’s perfectly clear.
Thanks for doing this.</p>

			<p>These tutorials are great!</p>
<p>I have been doing a bit of hobby programming in c++ for a good while
and wanted to see what all the fuss was about with XNA and C# and saw
this site.</p>
<p>As has been said your tutorials are great at mixing theory and
pratices - coming from a c++ background I feel like I am learning more
c++ as well when watching these. Becuase you are clearly marking each
tutorial as either theory or practice it means I was able to skip the
few first theory tutorials - if you had mixed them I would have had to
watch stuff I most likely already knew</p>
<p>Keep up the great work!</p>

			<p>Hey Joran, thanks for the great tutorials.</p>
<p>Having been programming with C++ for a moderate amount of time now,
a friend of mine convinced me to try C# and XNA. Your tutorials are the
best I have found so far for XNA, as many other tutorials go straight
into 3D without explaining any concepts or actually teaching us
anything.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to the next set of tutorials, and will be checking here regularly for an update.</p>
<p>Thanks again for giving back to the community <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"></p>

You explain everything very very clearly.<br>
I have already programmed in C++,<br>
but still, your first videos (exept installation etc..)<br>
give a very very good refresh of the OOP theory.</p>
<p>I’m awaiting the next pack with impatience <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>I’m currently trying to get some more advanced functionality with Farseer,<br>
but since there’s so little documentation,<br>
it’s hard…</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

			<p>I
just wanted to congratulate you on your clear, concise tutorials. I
even understand polymorphism now, yupeee, so I’ll be following the rest
of the videos. Thank you for your time and energy that you have put
into these.</p>

			<p>Jordon,
the tutorials are fantastic! Coming from a C++ background I found even
the first tutorials extremly educational as a primer for C#.</p>
<p>I am still filled with questions that were left unaswered in several of the videos like exporting variables to an XML file.<br>
Writing a class to manage the assets such as Update() and LoadGraphics().</p>
<p>In particular when I make my two sprites after Tutorial #30 I have
them randomly being drawn on the screen and I’m not sure where would be
the most oppropriate place to position them. Does this happen inside
Engine()? Or do I have to go back and rewrite certain functions of
Sprite class.</p>

			<p>Michael Kofman: “Where would be the most appropriate place to position sprites?”</p>
<p>How about a SpriteManager class? Engine instantiates the manager,
passing the level to load to it. The manager then reads the appropriate
level file (XML), and instantiates all the sprites needed, passing the
starting locations to each sprite.</p>
<p>I’ve got something along these lines coming up. Sorry that it has
been a while without new video packs. I’ve not forgotten about this
site, and will add more. Soonish, as usual. (c: No, seriously. Work
will lighten up soon, giving me some much needed spare time.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br>
Joran</p>

			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I went trough all the tuts on this site and I must
say they are really good and explain xna and C# really well for a
newbie like me.<br>
I’m glad to hear that you will be uploading the next set soon, looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Good luck :),<br>

			<p>i
have never had such in depth tutorials. I have been programming in
VB.NET for 2 years and i wanted to take a switch to game programming so
i kept trying to pick up C# here and there and i couldn’t get very much
help with tutorials until i found this. I understand a lot more.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time it is much appreciated<br>

well I can understand its a lack of time issue but I really hope one

			<p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>Thank you for the praise. Like most of you have guessed, work is
bogging me down. I won’t go into details, but it’s more than full time
right now.</p>
<p>There will be more tutorials. I can’t swear that the current series
will continue until a full game has been finished, because I’ve evolved
since I did the packs that you’ve seen. The plan is to round off that
series with a level loader reading XML, then start a new series. The
reason I want to start anew is twofold:</p>
<p>First, I have seen the light that is component-oriented design. The series so far has been very inheritance-driven.</p>
<p>Second, I have changed my belief in people’s potential. I used to
think that it was good to start with 2D, then move into 3D. Now, I
believe people are ready for 3D right from the start.</p>
<p>I’m not going to give you a guess on when I will be able to pick
things up. I’m not making that mistake again… I’m just going to say
that you shouldn’t expect too much before XNA 2.0 is out, considering
my work situation.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br>
Joran</p>

			<p>Jose asked:<br>
What do you think about a XNA certification?</p>
<p>Sure, why not? Not everybody learns in school, and Microsoft’s
certification program has always been a way through for such people.
They have certifications for web developers and windows application
developers, so it could fit in there somewhere.</p>
<p>One problem for the future, though. I expect you will be able to run
your XNA application in a web browser in a year or two. Does that mean
you are a web developer or a Windows developer? Maybe it’s just easier
to make an XBOX path, and clump in XNA windows developers in that path.</p>
<p>It could be a fourth path for MCPDs:<br>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/default.mspx</a></p>
<p>or possibly demanding an expanded version of the MCTS Windows Application Developer, with XNA tacked on:<br>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/winapps/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/winapps/default.mspx</a></p>
<p>Both of the above paths are newer than MCAD, if I know Microsoft’s certifications:<br>

			<p>Hi, Jöran,</p>
<p>I’ve just started to get to know XNA. I’m up to program XBOX. <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley">
Anyway, I started with your tutorials. I would say that a 7 year old
kid could understand how XNA works based on the explanations and
examples you provide in your videos. Well, I’m familiar with C# so I
just skip them anyway.</p>
<p>Tha reason I write to you that I found a bug in the section creating the Animatio class (pack 8, video 24). Here it is:</p>
<p>public bool IsStarted<br>
{<br>
	get { return IsStarted; }<br>
	set { IsStarted = value; }<br>
}</p>
<p>Accidentally you use the property insted of the field creating an
endless loop resulting on the crash of the program. (Didn’t tried, have
no time, but I’m pretty sure it will crash with stach overplow error.)</p>
<p>In your next “video release” you should correct this little mistake.
More imparant for the ones who are not good at properties and fields…</p>
<p>Is there only these 30 videos? (Pack 9 is the last.)</p>
<p>Thanks again for the grait tutorials! <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>

<p>Yes, that would be a mistake/bug/feature. (c: Thank you for catching it!</p>
<p>‘Is there only these 30 videos? (Pack 9 is the last.)’</p>
<p>Yes, there are only thirty. I’m swamped with work for a while longer. I’ll get back to XNA early 2008.</p>

			<p>Wow
these people all seem so smart…im just going to put it in my own words.
I cant thank you enough for putting in the time to make these tutorials
and help all the aspiring programmers (like me) to learn how to
program. Im actually a 15 year old kid whose goal is to work as a
programmer in the industry <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley">
but thats beside the point. You make the tutorials very interesting and
your making me stay up later than normal because i want to learn more.
So thank you for posting great tutorials and keep up the AMAZING work.</p>

			<p>These are probably the best tutorials on XNA I have ever seen. They’re clear, concise, intersesting and fun. </p>
<p>Up until recently I was just sort of dipping in and out of various
books catching fragments of information but not really getting much
done in the way of learning. I can’t count the amount of times, while
watching your tutorials, that I almost dropped to my knees shouting
“oh, sweet revelation!” ha ha.</p>
<p>Thank you so much Joran, you are a good teacher and I can’t wait to see your next set of videos. Maybe you should write a book.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>Thank you all. Now that XNA GS 2.0 is out, I will have to update my
videos. I had several pedagogic insights while making the previous
video tutorial series, so I spent New Years Eve on a beach, sketching
out a path for XnaTutorial.com 2.0, or whatever I should call it.</p>
<p>With increased clarity, I think I can up the difficulty as well, so
I will probably switch from 2D to 3D. 2D will still figure in the
videos, as there is need for menus and HUDs and such. I will also try
to make the path fork in a few places, so you don’t have to sit through
episodes which are below your level of expertise. While this makes it
possible to cater to old ‘customers’, I still don’t alienate newcomers.</p>
<p>Anyhow, my point is that I will probably start over. I will most
likely make a new series, which will cater to both new and old visitors.</p>
<p>I finish my current project on the last of January. Unfortunately,
I’m signing up for a new contract starting on the first of March, but I
am hoping that it will take a few months before that project really
picks up pace, so i should be able to get in some solid new videos
during the early part of this year.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Joran</p>

i love your tours. great work.<br>
but if i may ask one thing of you for people who are easly side tracked.<br>
can you bring your voice out more maybe abit more emotion in it. get
excited on the bigger things that we need to know. not to the point you
sound stupid just enough to keep us awake bud. im not trying to be
terribly rude but focus on something that sounds like the dry eyes
commercial is hard.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything else.<br>

			<p>Joran,</p>
<p>What a wonderful contribution you have made to the world of Game
development! Being a seasoned programmer (18+ years), I am still amazed
at how much knowledge there is to absorb, and your tutorials cut
straight and true even for a ole war horse like myself. I’m surprised
that you do not have a pay-pal button for contributions to your effort.
I’d certainly chip in, knowing how much work went into these tutorials.
</p>
<p>I would like to see you delve into 3d graphics a bit more, and
perhaps more theory behind physics engines. And of course using Blender
to create custom graphics for the game. You do such an excellent job, I
hate to look elswhere for guidance.</p>
<p>With great respect,<br>
Mark</p>

			<p>Joran,</p>
<p>First off, great tutorials. I have absolutely no knowledge of
programming and your tutorials are doing a fantastic job of introducing
things.<br> I did have one problem with the tutorial in the early
stages, however, I found a solution for it and was wondering if it was
a real fix or not. I am using GameStudio 2.0 and when I added the
resources and textures folder, I could not reference them in the code
(it could not find the path when it tried to run). What I did was make
a textures folder in the Content folder already provided, and that path
was recognized. Is this the proper way to do it in 2.0 or was I most
likely doing something wrong before and this just happened to be done
correctly?<br>
Other than that everything has been working great. Thanks again for the
great tutorials. Now it’s time for me to start #21.</p>

			<p>Joran,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for making these tutorials, they are helping me a lot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I also have run into the same issue as Jess did: </p>
<p>“I’ve run into a bit of a problem though, on the 13th video where
you write the path to the image you want to show up, Visual C# express
says that it cannot find the file. The code mirrors yours exactly
(except for the image name) and I’ve done everything else fine too. It
compiles without any problem but this. Help please?”</p>
<p>I’ve also noticed one other thing though.. when i go to properties,
all the info under your XNA tab, i don’t have. (i.e. I don’t see the
Asset Name, Content Importer, Content Processor, etc.)</p>
<p>Any help anyone could give on this would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>thanks in advance,<br>
Taylor</p>

			<p>Taylor,
you probably have XNA game studio 2, you should place your
images/textures and so on in the content folder witch is created by XNA
when you first create your project.</p>
<p>also, if you in any case deleted this like from the constructor method of you engine:Content.RootDirectory = “Content”;</p>
<p>you should paste that back in, then when you recompile it should work fine.</p>

			<p>Thanks Joran,</p>
<p>Thought I would say something as well since I took the time to go
over all your tutorials. I thought they were great. I believe I learned
more watching these tutorials than I did when I took a class on object
oriented programming in C#… at least more on what I wanted to learn <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>I, for one, am very interested in 2D games. I like how these
tutorials revolved around the 2D environment. I read in a previous post
that you may go to the 3D route, but you would allow multiple paths for
how you want to design your game. So does this mean you will teach for
both 2D and 3D games at the same time? I wouldn’t think there would be
much of a logical difference between the two, but I’m also not that
experienced in the programming field.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

			<p>WOW!
Joran, thank you! I was eager to make the leap from programming to
doing some fun game stuff but had no idea where to start.<br>
I finally decided to start with XNA and after some BRUTAL hours in the XNA documentation I found these tutorials.</p>
<p>Joran, you are a great teacher. You explain things in clear and
comprehensive fashion. I could not have done better if I had paid for
these lessons!</p>
<p>(Actually, like the previous poster.. I have paid for plenty of OOPs
classes and I wish you had been teaching them, I probably would have
gained alot more knowledge! Thanks!)</p>

			<p>Hi,
i have a “little” problem here. When i right click on the “box.png” and
then click on properties, i can’t see any “XNA framework content
pipeline” category as you have in the 13th part of the tutorial. I have
visual studio 2005 express edition (C#) and i also have XNA game studio
2.0. Because of that problem, i can’t set up asset name for the box.png
and it pops up error which tells “contentLoadException was unhandled”
and some little window.. But build is always succeeded.</p>

			<p>I am having the same problem as “Gobo” on June 15th, 2008 at 1:21 pm</p>
<p>He stated<br>
“Hi, i have a “little” problem here. When i right click on the
“box.png” and then click on properties, i can’t see any “XNA framework
content pipeline” category as you have in the 13th part of the
tutorial. I have visual studio 2005 express edition (C#) and i also
have XNA game studio 2.0. Because of that problem, i can’t set up asset
name for the box.png and it pops up error which tells
“contentLoadException was unhandled” and some little window.. But build
is always succeeded.”</p>
<p>I am having this same issue, not sure why though as i have followed
the instructions perfectly. I am also getting 2 warnings when compiling
they are listed below any help would be great.</p>
<p>Member ‘Mech.Engine.LoadGraphicsContent(bool)’ overrides obsolete
member ‘Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.LoadGraphicsContent(bool)’. Add
the Obsolete attribute to ‘Mech.Engine.LoadGraphicsContent(bool)’.<br>
Engine.cs</p>
<p>Member ‘Mech.Engine.UnloadGraphicsContent(bool)’ overrides obsolete
member ‘Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.UnloadGraphicsContent(bool)’. Add

			<p>I would like to state that i have corrected the issue that happened for the picture.</p>
<p>What i had to do was move the folders i created called resources &gt; textures &gt; with box.png </p>
<p>I moved them to the section called content in the solution and this fixed the problem.</p>

			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>GREAT tutorial. Really helped me.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it would be unbelievable cool if you would extend it
onto Farseer much more. Especially with the new versions of Farseer and
XNA.</p>

the tutorials are great. Slow moving and easy to understand. However i
just wanted one help. As I am just a beginner I would like to
understand what is exactly happening when we initialize and load and
unload contents etc in a schematic diagram if possible. Just to get a
birds eye view on how the program is actually displaying a sprite , how
are all the functions actually integrated.</p>

			<p>Excellent
tutorial, including a physics engine! Just one question, will there be
more? The last set (package 9) mentioned doing more and even making
editors… Has this series stalled or will there be more? I also believe
Joran mentioned above (back on January 2nd, his last post here) the
posibility of starting over with XNA 2.0 and making new tutorials. Has
anything been started on that?</p>
<p>I loved these tutorials and can’t wait for more! BTW, the latest
Farseer physics engine has changed quite a bit from the tutorial above.
There is no RigidBody or RectangleBody anymore, you use
BodyFactory.Instance.CreateRectangleBody(…) to create a Body, and I
also had do GeomFactory.Instance.CreateRectangleGeom(this.physicsBody,
…) to create a Geom object (also registered with the Physics engine) in
order to get the collision to work. So it looks like it’s been
redesigned a lot since these tutorials were made.</p>
<p>I’m excited to learn more about how to use Farseer and see more of these tutorials!  Great job so far, Joran!</p>

			<p>It’s funny how he sounds like he’s ready to do video 31 soon with more stuff with the mouse right away. However that is the end.</p>
<p>to be a bit more informative with getting the farseer physics to
work. As was mentioned in another comment, you need to make an object
besides the physics.Dynamics.Body, which is a physics.collision.Geom. I
found it easiest to initialize it after you’ve fully initialized the
body, because you pass the body in as a parameter to the new Geom
(instructions are in Leep’s comment).</p>
<p>After you’ve done that be sure to register both the Geom and the Body to the physics engine [Physics.add()]</p>
<p>Nearly foolproof tutorial, even being over 2 years old, and 2 versions behind it works great.</p>

			<p>Joran,</p>
<p>Excellent tutorial series. I can’t wait for more (I hope there is
more to follow). I have skipped around a bit and also I have watched
some of the lessons several times. I am especially interested in
reading in an XML file. I did not see that in this series, but either I
can wait a while for the next installment or figure it out myself. I
will go back and watch again to see if I skipped over it.</p>
<p>It would be nice if “students” could submit future tutorials in this series.  Just something to think about.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

			<p>Hey
Joran, Thanks for posting these videos. I am on pack 6 right now. I was
wondering if you will continue doing these? I really like them. XNA 3.0
is coming out soon. I wouldn’t worry as much about starting over with
each version. I would finish your tutorials. Then updated them all when
each new version comes out!</p>

			<p>Heya man. I hope this gets to you over the spam. Im posting because the download manual for Farseer 2.0.1 isn’t working. </p>
<p>Pack 9: If you know. Where do you declare the vertices in 2.0.1 like you did with the beta version of RigidBody?<br>
Now there is only Body, and the newest version no longer has the PhysicsEngine.BodyFactory.CreateRectangleBody();</p>

			<p>I
found it. This is the first time i’ve compiled source for a dll instead
of jsut using dll. Forgot I could just search for Rectangle Body. My
solution was:</p>
<p>using FarseerGames.FarseerPhysics.Factories;<br>
…<br>
this.physicsBody = ….<br>
BodyFactory.Instance.CreateRectangleBody(this.animation.Size.X, …<br>
this.animation.Size.Y, mass);</p>

			<p>In
addition. Thanks for the tutorials. They have helped me understand more
about C# than most other tutorials. Now I can actually get one with
making my game instead of hand coding physics on the spot all the time.</p>
<p>Also as far as tutorials go. If New XNA versions come out and you
are still working on this tutorial just keep forging ahead with the new
version.</p>
<p>If you provide a link to the change log people can just search the
page for the changes that are messing them up. Its a great way to learn.</p>

<p>In XNA Game Studio 3.0 they have modified the the way to add a

solution Explorer and add an existing item like before.</p>
<p>It is all explaint on this side.<br>

<p>Visual C# files<br>
content pipeline files<br>
Data files</p>
<p>and so on….but all i get is</p>
<p>Visual C# files<br>
Data files</p>
<p>see i dont get that content pipeline option that joran has and i dont know why,can somebody please help me <img src="XNAtutorial.com%20%C2%BB%20Download_files/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley"> </p>

			<p>I
just went through the whole set, very impressive and informational, I
learned more from these videos in two evenings than I did from the
first few programming classes I took.</p>
<p>For those wondering, almost everything works in the current (3.0)
version of XNA, the exception is the path to the resources has changed.</p>
<p>In the video he right clicks on the project to add a resources
folder, and then adds the texture folder to that. In the new version
they have a content section made for you, so you right click on the
Content sub-section of your project and add your resource folders to
that.</p>
<p>Everything else you can create where the author creates it. Also, as
long as you put your folders in the content area but name them the same
as he does your path names in the code will look the same as his.</p>
<p>I hope this was helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

			<p>The
tutorials are great! Except I ran into a problem on #13, with the
Graphics Engine…..when I try to load the .png file for the
LoadGraphicsContent, it says it cannot find the file, I followed it
step by step how you did….but I noticed that on your Solution, you
don’t have a Content folder like i do….</p>
<p>..and when I go to Properties on my .png file, it says the name, but
also just calls it a file name, and not an asset name like on yours….</p>
<p>what is this?</p>

<p> Great job forum crew!</p>
<p>Yesterday I read that there is a cure for diabetes on <a>www.healthcaredaily.org</a><br>
Can diabetes seriously be cured? The source looks like a reliable healthcare news website </p>
<p>Has anyone tried beating diabetes this way?</p>

I was wondering what screencasting program did you use? it seems to me
that it’s not comtasia and it doesn’t seem to be comstudio.<br>
Great tutorials, you have a knack for teaching.</p>

			<p>This
tutorial was made in ‘06. It does not cover 3.0 or 3.1, I dont even
think it covers 2.0. But mostly you can do it this way just exclued
some of the stuff. For matthew and others that have that problem you
just need @textures\cursor) leave out resources as xna 2.0 got rid of
needing resources needing to be added to access, Good tutorial though.</p>
