<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I wrote this tutorial in 2000, and intended
it for students learning traditional, hand-drawn animation.
Nevertheless, the principles can be adapted to Flash or 3D animation.
The main tutorial page is <a href="http://www.angryanimator.com/word/2008/10/index.shtml">here</a> (there’s a walk cycle tuturial, and I’ll be adding Flash lessons soon).<br>
This exercise will teach you the most important priciples of animation, namely:</p>
<blockquote><p>Arcs.<br>
Timing/Spacing.<br>
Squash and Stretch.<br>
Volume.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the first lesson taught to any animation student. It may
seem boring, but by following it you will grasp most of the principals
used in animation. Study the bouncing ball scene above: Look at it
again with all the frames superimposed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="bouncing ball arc paths and spacing" src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/bal01.gif" alt="" width="590" height="369"></p>
<p>Now some of the techniques used become easier to see.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Arcs.</strong> The ball falls in an elliptical arc
through space. Most things move in an arc of some kind. If the ball
were to move in a straight line between the high and low points of the
bounce, then the action would look very unnatural.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Timing.</strong> (or Spacing). As the ball falls it is
accelerated by gravity, the gap between each frame growing all the time
until the ball contacts the ground. As the ball bounces from the ground
the opposite happens: as the ball hops up it moves very fast at first,
then slows down by gravity into the high piont of its bounce. Note that
at the high point of the bounce the ball is weightless…perfectly
balanced between the force of gravity pulling it down, and its own
momentum moving it forward.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Squash and Stretch.</strong> As the ball falls it
stretches. When it impacts the ground it squashes. When it bounces off
the ground it stretches again. Note how quickly the ball regains its
circular shape. Too much squash and stretch can make an object look
“mushy”.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Volume.</strong> The ball should remain the same mass as
it squashes and stretches. If the ball were to squash too much it would
seem to be growing physically bigger. This is very eye catching, and
looks weird.</p>
<p><strong>How to animate the ball.</strong> The process of animating the ball is straightforward. On a single sheet of paper, draw the arc path that the ball will follow.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/bal02.gif" alt="figure 2: bouncing ball arcs" width="580" height="363"></p>
<p>On this drawing, tick off the position of each ball on the arc path
with an X. Be sure to number them. In feature and tv animation, frames
are usually numbered 1,3,5,7,9 and so on. To simplify things here,
let’s number them 1,2,3,4, etc. For an explanation of why odd numbers
are used in animation, see the appendix at the bottom of the page. It’s
really boring, and should be a really nice cure for insomnia.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/bal03.gif" alt="figure 3: arcs with frame numbers" width="580" height="363"></p>
<p>If you have a backlight, then switch it on. Put a clean sheet over
the arc path drawing. Now you are ready to begin drawing the “Key”
drawings of the animation: the points where the ball is at its most
extreme. In this example, its highest and lowest points in the
bounce.As you can see, frame 1 is the first and highest point in the
sequence. It is therefore an extreme drawing. Frame 7 is the squash
drawing where the ball hits the ground. It is also an extreme, as are
drawings 12,17,21,25,28 and 31.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/bal04.gif" alt="figure 4: arcs and extreme ball positions" width="580" height="363"></p>
<p>On seperate sheets of paper, you should draw the different key
frames as named above. If done correctly you should have a series of
drawing numbered 1,7,12,17,21,25,28 and 31.Be sure that you write the
frame numbers on the top right and bottom right of each drawing. If
your drawing is a key frame (as these are) then put a circle around the
number.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/bal05.gif" alt="figure 5: drawing 1" width="580" height="363"></p>
<p>Place them on the peg bar with the lower numbers on the bottom and
the higher numbers on the top. Now you are ready to “roll” the drawings.</p>
<p><strong>How to Roll the drawings:</strong>A lot of people working in
animation seem to forget how tricky this is. It is a fairly easy skill,
it just takes a little practice. Do it slowly at first, as you progress
you’ll begin to do it instinctively. There are people working in the
industry who aren’t smart enough to chew gum and fart at the same time,
and they can do it. So don’t worry. It takes a little time, but you’ll
get the hang of it.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/roll1.gif" alt="rolling paper" width="138" height="104"></p>
<p>Back to the ball: Now you must add the inbetween frames. These are
the drawings that go between the keys in order to make the action look
smooth. It’s common for these to be called “tweens”, thanks to digital
animation programs - but traditional animators call them “inbetweens”
(the correct term).</p>
<p>All frames are equal, but some frames are more equal than others.
You must determine which is the most important frame to draw next.
Which has the most important action?</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/bal06.gif" alt="figure 6: main stretch drawing" width="580" height="363"></p>
<p>In this case, the most important is frame 6. It is the most
stretched frame in the falling sequence. Therefore I would consider
this almost as much a key frame as 1 and 7. If you have a backlight,
switch it on. Put the arc path drawing on the pegs first. Then put down
1. Put down 7. Then put down a blank sheet. You should see something
like this:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/bal07.gif" alt="figure 7: first two keyframes" width="580" height="363"></p>
<p>Now you are going to draw frame 6. Begin to sketch in the stretched
ball. When stretching the ball, keep the volume consistent. The overall
mass of the ball must be the same. Position it around the x drawn on
the arc path. When you have finished, you will have to flip the paper
to see if it moves right:</p>
<p><strong>How to flip the drawings:</strong></p>
<p>Flipping is similar to rolling, but whereas with rolling you move
through the pages sequentially, here you move from the bottom drawing,
to the top one, then to the middle one. “WHY?” you ask….because this
way you can see the inbetween in motion and make subtle corrections as
you work. Incredible as it seems, this method is far more accurate than
a lighttable.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/flip1.gif" alt="flipping paper" width="138" height="104"></p>
<p>Watch the paper closely. Notice that both index and middle fingers
are wedged between the top two layers. You begin flipping by holding up
both top sheets of paper towards you. You are now looking at the lowest
frame, frame 1. Then you drop the two sheets down to the board,
revealing the topmost drawing, i.e. the inbetween frame. Then you lift
up the top drawing to reveal the one in the middle, i.e the final
keyframe. It takes time to get the hang of this. It will be well worth
the effort if you do.</p>
<p>Now you will need to add the remaining inbetween drawings between 1
and 5. The easiestway to do this is with a timing chart. Lets look at
what we’ve got so far:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/bal09.gif" alt="figure 8: the spacing of the first 7 drawings" width="580" height="363"></p>
<p>You could “eyeball” all the remaining frames, but the surest way to
do them is by writing a timing chart. It will look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/bal10.gif" alt="figure 9: the timing chart" width="580" height="363"></p>
<p>The timing chart will go on frame 1, beneath the frame number on the
top right of the drawing. This chart tells you that the next most
important drawing is 5. That’s why it’s underlined. Note how the
spacing on the timing chart relates to the spacing on the arc path
above. The chart can determine the position of all the inbetween
frames, and also their weight, mass, speed, etc.</p>
<p>Now you have keyframe 1 with a timing chart, and keyframe 6. Simply
follow the chart, place the arc path on your drawing board, then 1,
Then 6, and proceed to follow the timing chart. Draw 5.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/bal11.gif" alt="figure 10: keep the ball shapes solid" width="580" height="363"></p>
<p>Note: see how quickly the ball regained its shape…if you were to
inbetween the shape as well as the position of the ball then the ball
would feel very mushy…by drawing 5 as circular, the scene will be much
snappier. Repeat inbetweening until the first arc of the bounce is
complete. Repeat the process for all frames of the scene.</p>
<p>I have included all the original frames for this scene as digital
files. They should print out onto regular A4 printer paper. You can
print them out and peg them up onto strips of punched paper, allowing
you to roll through the scene. You line them up with the crosshairs on
the corners of the page. Simply paste up frame 1 as you like it, then
put it on your drawing board. Then put down a strip of punched paper,
and position frame 2 with its crosshairs lined up with frame 1.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: all frames should be positioned against frame 1, otherwise the scene will “drift”.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-1%20%20%20bouncing%20ball_files/board.gif" alt="drawing board" width="580" height="363"></p>
<p>You can find the files here: <a href="http://www.angryanimator.com/tut/pic/001_bouncingball/assets.rar">Bouncing ball image files</a> . You’ll need winrar to decompress them (most zip programs should work on them).</p>
<p>Appendix: Numbering drawings.</p>
<p>Most animation is still produced for film and tv. Film is projected
at 24 frames per second (fps). Early cartoons were all drawn with 24
drawings for every second of film, i.e. onedrawing for every frame of
film. Some clever chap finally realised that the animation looked just
as good if only 12 drawings were drawn per second of film. Each drawing
would be shot twice, to keep the overall timing the same. Nobody
noticed the difference, and a lot of carpal tunnel doctors went out of
business.</p>
<p>This discovery can be attributed entirely to prohibition. Animators
of the twenties were notorious alcoholics. Not these days, glad to say.
Today’s breed are wholesome family men, loyal to their wives, good
fathers, upstanding members of society, clean living wackos.</p>
<p>The practice of animating 12 fps is called animating “on twos”, and
the practice of animating 24 fps is called animating “on ones”. It was
still occasionally necessary to animate scenes on ones if a fast action
was required, or if the camera panned over the background, i.e. move
from left to right to follow a character across the screen. Such shots
would look jerky if shot on twos.</p>
<p>When working on twos the animators usually number their frames with
odd numbers. 1,3,5 and so on. Frame one is shot twice, frame two is
shot twice, ad nauseum. If a point in the scene demands a fast action
such as a punch or a shake, then the scene can be switched to ones at
thatpoint. The numbering can then include the even numbers that will
make the action smoother.</p>
<p>If all this sounds like gibberish, don’t worry. It’s not relevant to anything in the next few lessons.</p>
<p>One last comment about timing: Today a lot of animation is made on
computers, and can be projected at any frame rate desired. 10 fps looks
fine. Most Japanese animation has been animated at 8 fps for years…a
method known as animating “on threes”, as each drawing is shot 3 times,
producing 8 frames per second.</p>
<p>That’s it for the ball…</p>
