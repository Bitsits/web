</p><p>
Most sane people have a fear of animating walk cycles. Many events are
happening at the same time, and it can seem overwhelming. A single
mistake on your first drawing can wreck the rest of the scene. However,
the process can be broken down into a series of steps which can go some
distance in simplifying the process.</p>
<p>A walk cycle can be described by four distinct poses:</p>
<p><strong>CONTACT, RECOIL, PASSING</strong> and <strong>HIGH-POINT.</strong></p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk01.gif" alt="" width="580" height="190"></p>
<p>These four poses and a handful of inbetween drawings constitute a
walk cycle. The single most important frame of the four is the contact
pose. Once you draw it you have already determined 80% of the rest of
your walk. If you make a mistake on your contact pose, it can be very
difficult to correct later on. Therefore: pay close attention now and
save yourself a world of pain.</p>
<p>Here is the contact pose in front and side view.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk02.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435">Look
at the pose carefully. You will notice some very important details: The
feet are at their furthest extension in the walk. That is their most
extreme position in the cycle. That alone makes this the most critical
pose in the sequence. You can plan an entire walk sequence just by
laying out all the contact poses as they work into one another.</p>
<p><strong>Some animators think that the recoil and high points are the
most important poses because the head is at its highest and lowest
positions. This is wrong. The contact pose is the fundamental building
block of a walk cycle. If you do not start your cycle with this pose,
then you are doomed. It’s as simple as that.</strong></p>
<p>When the right foot is forward, the right arm is back, and vice
versa. This is called “counterpose”. This is how nature keeps
everything in balance when you move: one side of the body “opposes” the
other. Good animation has these “opposing actions” all the time. If
animation seems weak or unnatural to you, it is frequently because it
lack opposing action. You can think of a walk as a series of “falls”.
The character propels himself forward by leaning into the walk as he
moves forward. His trailing foot constantly swings forward to catch
himself before he moves on to the next “fall” in the sequence. It
shares many attributes with the bouncing ball in tutorial 1. Look at
the front on view.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk03.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>I have drawn in imaginary cylinders to illustrate the orientation of
the shoulders and hips. Again, as one is thrust forward, the other is
thrust back. As one tilts up, the other tilts down.<br>
Another name for this is “Torque”. It is a fundamental principle of
good posing. It should be an element of almost every figure drawing
that you do. Michelangelo always used torque in his sculptures,
creating dynamic poses, even in ones that were standing still. One hip
takes the weight, while the other passively provides the balance.<br>
The body is very rarely symmetrical: indeed, symmetry can be your enemy.</p>
<p>Now look at the recoil pose, the second main pose in the cycle.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk04.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>This is the frame where the character impacts the ground. It is also
the lowest point in the cycle. The characters arms are furthest from
the body as a result of the force of hitting the ground. The front foot
is fully in contact with the ground; the rear foot has just lifted up
from it.<br>
Note that the leading foot is directly beneath the body, supporting the
weight above it. Too many beginners produce recoil poses where the foot
is not beneath the body, but several inches ahead of it. Try to avoid
this.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, let’s skip the passing pose…it’s closer to being an inbetween. Let’s look at the high point.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk05.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>This is the highest point in the cycle. The character’s body is
stretched to the maximum as he lifts his leading leg forward to reach
the next contact position. The heel of the trailing foot is just
beginning to leave the ground.</p>
<p>Those are the three most important poses to remember when creating a
walk animation. If you can wrap your head around them, you will have a
much better chance of completing a satisfactory walk cycle.</p>
<p>There are two basic ways to animate a walk cycle. You can animate
the cycle “in place” or across the screen. Here is the same scene shown
in each style.</p>
<div id="so_targ_wlk03_940152736" class="flashmovie"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
	// <![CDATA[

	var so_940152736 = new SWFObject("http://www.angryanimator.com/tut/pic/002_walkcycle/wlk03.swf","fm_wlk03_940152736","580","300","6","","","","","");
	so_940152736.write("so_targ_wlk03_940152736");

	// ]]>
</script>

<p>
</p><div id="so_targ_wlk01_479535680" class="flashmovie"></div>

<p>
</p><p>Why animate in place? There is one main advantage:</p>
<p>You only have to draw a single stepping cycle, then you can reposition it across the screen, saving time and paper.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of animating in place:<br>
1.It can be confusing.<br>
2.The “arcs” on the character can look weird when the character is moved across the screen.<br>
3.It can be difficult to match the character properly to the background, if he has to register to something on it.</p>
<p>I am going to show you how to animate a character walking across the
page. Once you feel comfortable with that, an in-place walk cycle
should be slightly less intimidating.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<p>Look at this image:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk08.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"><br>
This shows the keyframes of a walk cycle moving across the screen. The
most important pose is the contact pose. Use this image as an overall
guide to your scene.</p>
<p><strong>1.Guideline.</strong><br>
On a clean sheet of paper, draw two parallel horizontal lines moving across the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk09.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"><br>
These are the lines that the feet will follow as they walk across the
page. Without these lines to guide you, your character can drift either
too high or too low on the page.</p>
<p><strong>2.Draw the first contact pose.</strong><br>
Put a clean sheet of paper down over the guideline drawing. You are going to draw the first contact drawing.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk10.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"><br>
Position the heel of the right foot on the lower line; position the
toes of the left foot on the upper line. Name this drawing #1, and
since it is a contact pose I usually write the letter “c” in the top
right of the page, above and away from the frame number. (This is a
habit of mine, I don’t know if anyone else does it….you will find that
it helps to reduce confusion when you have 12 drawings flying all over
your drawing board.) Don’t forget to circle the drawing number, since
it is a key.</p>
<p><strong>3. Draw the second contact pose, drawing 7.</strong><br>
If you have a backlight then switch it on. Put down a clean sheet.
Number it #7. Circle the number, as this is a key frame. Write the
letter “C” above the frame number, to remind you that it’s a contact
pose.</p>
<p>Note that the second contact pose occurs about half a second after
the first. Here’s how you position the second contact relative to the
first: The leading foot on #1 will be the trailing foot on #7. In this
case the right foot is about to contact the ground on #1. In frames #1
through #7 it is going to hit the ground and more or less stay there.
By frame #7 it will have begun to lift off the ground. Look at the
picture below to see how #1 works into #7:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk11.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"><br>
The right foot (the leading one) has touched the ground and the entire
body has moved forward. The left foot (the far one) has now swung
forward and is now about to contact the ground.<br>
Lightly sketch it in, keeping the overall attitude as similar to #1 as
possible. The only differences will be the arms, legs and orientation
of the hips, all of which will be reversals of #1.<br>
After you have roughly sketched in the second contact pose, you’ll have
to check it against the first. Lift #7 off the pegs, and position it
over #1. Flip #1 against #7 to see that both drawings have the same
volume and attitude. You don’t want either to look bigger or smaller
than the other. Also, both should be leaning forward into the walk at
the same angle. If not, your walk will look more like a limp.</p>
<p>Now that you have drawn these two poses, you can begin to block in
the main keys between them. First, an overview of what is going to
happen.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk13.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>Here are the main keys. The contact, recoil and high point drawings.
Remember these positions when you begin to draw them in on their own
sheets of paper. If you were to positon #2 too high for example, it
would make #5 very difficult to draw properly: the overall action would
be too “tight”…not enough bounce in the walk.</p>
<p>This would feel like a very stiff cycle, unnatural for a cartoony character. See what I mean below:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk14.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>The opposite is also dangerous: moving the recoil too far down can
result in a wildly exagerrated action, too unbelievable for all but the
weirdest characters:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk15.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>Just bear in mind that after the first contact, the character works
down into the recoil, then up into the high point, then back into the
next contact where the pattern is repeated:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk16.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p><strong>4. Draw the recoil pose</strong><br>
(Bear in mind my rant in the previous paragraph). Put down a clean
sheet, number it #2 in the top right of the page, write the letter “R”
beside that, and draw the character as his foot hits the ground. The
character will be at his lowest point in the cycle. Don’t move the head
and body too far forward or you can inadvertently cause any number of
arcing problems later on.</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk17.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>I find as a general rule of thumb that the body should fall by half
a head to one head in height to keep the walk “bouncy” enough. (It’s a
common beginner’s mistake to keep the figure at the same height
throughout the entire walk.)</p>
<p>Remember…the recoil position will be almost identical later in the walk, on the subsequent step:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk18.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>This is what will determine the overall arc pattern, and the
positions of all the poses inbetween the recoil and the following
contact pose. On the recoil pose the character impacts the ground. The
rear foot lifts off, and the arms are extended to their maximum from
the body because of the force of hitting the ground.</p>
<p>Now a brief note on the overall timing of a walk.</p>
<p>The most general type of walk cycle is completed over the course of
one second. This means that the character makes a single step every
half second. This is known as hitting beats, and luckily two beats a
second is a typical musical pattern, or so I’m told. We’re animating
this scene on the typical 12 frames per second, therefore the overall
sequence of drawings so far will look like this:</p>
<p>#01:contact<br>
#02:recoil<br>
#03:<br>
#04:<br>
#05:<br>
#06:<br>
#07:contact (much like #1, but for the reversal of the legs and arms).<br>
#08:recoil<br>
#09:<br>
#10:<br>
#11:<br>
#12:<br>
#13:contact ( a duplicate of #1, only further to the right).</p>
<p>As you can see, a complete cycle works from #01 to #12, beginning
its repeat on#13. I put the recoil immediately following the contact
without an inbetween between them because an inbetween frame would make
it look “mushy”. The contact should usually snap into the recoil
immediately, without an intervening drawing.</p>
<p>I have not named the frame that the high point will go on. I could
assign it as #4 #05 or #06. A different frame number will make quite a
difference to the properties of the character. Here is why:</p>
<p>If #04 is the high point the walk will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk19.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>As you can see above, this makes the character “bounce off the ground very quickly, making him light footed.</p>
<p>If #06 is the high point the walk will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk20.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>This timing above slows down the character as he rises from the recoil pose, making him seem a lot heavier.</p>
<p>I will take the middle path and name the high point #05, resulting in this:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk21.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"><br>
This is a more even timing: it should make the character seem like an
average weight, without any extreme attributes. These are the kinds of
decisions that you should make before you begin animating. Now we can
look at our overall exposure sequence again:</p>
<p>#01:contact<br>
#02:recoil<br>
#03:<br>
#04:<br>
#05:high point.<br>
#06:<br>
#07:contact (much like #1, but for the reversal of the legs and arms).<br>
#08:recoil (like #02, arms and legs reversed).<br>
#09:<br>
#10:<br>
#11:high point. (like #05, arms and legs reversed).<br>
#12:<br>
#13:contact ( a duplicate of #1, only further to the right).</p>
<p>Now we have our 3 main key frames, #1 #2 and #5, and their near
twins #7 #8 and #11. The empty spaces in the sequence above will all be
inbetweens. Don’t worry about them yet.<br>
For now we will focus on #1 thru # 07, finishing a single step.</p>
<p><strong>5. Draw the high point.</strong><br>
Put down a clean sheet. As explained above, this will be drawing number
#5. Write the number in the top right of the page. Circle it. Write a
small letter “H” above the number. Now begin the drawing:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk22.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>You have a little more freedom when drawing the limbs on the high
point than on the recoil, as the leading foot is up in the air, and the
arms are swinging over a pretty wide space. That gives you a number of
different possibilities. The example frame that I have included is
fairly typical.</p>
<p>The most important thing to get right with this drawing is the arc
path of the head and body. A mistake on this one frame will effect all
the inbetween frames around it.</p>
<p>Once that is finished, you are ready to move on.</p>
<p><strong>6.Add the timing charts.</strong></p>
<p>Before you do anything else, you should add the timing charts to
describe the correct positions of the inbetweens. Here are the drawings
we have finished so far:</p>
<p>#01:contact<br>
#02:recoil<br>
#03:<br>
#04:<br>
#05:high point.<br>
#07:contact (much like #1, but for the reversal of the legs and arms).</p>
<p>Timing charts need to be added to #2 and #5. The timing chart on #2
will describe the positions of #3 and #4 as they work into #5. The
chart on #5 will describe the position of #6.</p>
<p>Put #2 on the drawing board. Underneath the frame number in the top
right corner of the page, you will add the chart. Here’s what it should
look like:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk23.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>As you can see, #4 is the main inbetween halfway between the two
keyframes. #3 is a smaller inbetween which will completely smooth out
the motion.</p>
<p>The next timing chart to be added is on #5. Put #5 on the drawing
board and write a timing chart beneath the drawing number in the top
right corner of the page. It should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk24.gif" alt="" width="580" height="435"></p>
<p>This shows that #6 will be a single inbetween halfway between #5 and #7. Now it’s time to draw the inbetweens.</p>
<p><strong>7.Draw #4: the main inbetween.</strong></p>
<p>Be sure that you have the guideline drawing on the drawing board.Put
#2 on the pegs. Now put #5 above that. Put a clean sheet on top of all
three. Switch on the backlight. Now you must draw #4, also known as the
“passing position”. Some treat it as a key also, but to simplify
things, I’m treating it as an inbetween. I’ve never really found it to
be as critical as contact, recoil or high point poses.</p>
<p>You have to flip between #4 and the two key frames beneath it. You should remember that from the bouncing ball tutorial:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/flip1.gif" alt="" width="138" height="104"></p>
<p>Again, be sure that your character follows the arc path as he walks.
When you’re finished the drawing, remove the drawings from the pegs and
place #2, #4 and #5 back on the pegs in that sequence. Now you can roll
them to see if they move properly. You’ll also remember that from the
bouncing ball tutorial.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angryanimator.com/tut/pic/001_bouncingball/flip1.gif"><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/roll1.htm" alt=""></a>If
you see any errors in your inbetween, then you must lift the drawings
off the pegs again, then place #2 on the bottom, #5 above it, and #4 on
the top. Then you can flip again, correcting any errors that may have
crept in. It’s tedious, but it’s the only way to do it.</p>
<p><strong>8.Draw the remaining inbetweens.</strong></p>
<p>Repeat step 7 with #3 and #6. If you do them right then you should
be finished with the first half of the walk cycle. I hope you had fun,
but I doubt it.</p>
<p>You should be looking at a stack of paper, numbered #1 through #7.
If you put all those drawings on the pegs, you should be able to roll
them and have a rough idea of what your scene will look like when it’s
shot. If anything catches your eye, chances are it’s wrong. Go back in,
repeating the process described in step 7, until you’re happy with it.</p>
<p><strong>9.Finish the rest of the cycle (or else).</strong></p>
<p>Repeat the steps above to complete the rest of the walk cycle.
You’ll have to draw #13 (the third contact pose) to work into. Simply
trace off the pose on #1 onto #13 in its new position, further to the
right. If it took 2 inches to make a single step from #1 to#7, then
slide #13 over 4 inches to the left and start tracing…</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>The second half of the walk is identical to the first, except that the arms and legs will be on the opposite sides of the body.</p>
<p>Indeed, you can refer to the first half of your scene to help you
with the second. The recoil pose on #8 should be as similar to the
recoil pose on #2 as possible, otherwise the walk may seem uneven, or
even more like a limp.</p>
<p><strong>10. A general note about arcs.</strong></p>
<p>Every joint of the body has its own arc path. It’s a good idea to check them all. Here’s how.</p>
<p>Place all your drawings on the board. If you have a backlight switch
it on. Pick a body part, e.g. the right wrist. Place a clean sheet over
the drawings and draw a small dot on it at the position of the right
wrist on frame 1. On the same sheet draw a dot for the position fof the
wrist for #2…and so on.</p>
<p>By the time you’re finished you’ll have a sheet of paper that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk25.gif" alt="" width="580" height="180"></p>
<p>That’s what it looks like if it’s done properly. If you’ve made an arc mistake, it’ll look like this:</p>
<p><img src="angry%20animator%20%C2%BB%20animation%20tutorial-2%20%20%20walk%20cycle_files/wlk26.gif" alt="" width="580" height="180">If
your walk is to look smooth and natural, your arc paths must also be
smooth, curved, natural shapes. You should repeat this process for
every part of the body to make sure they all move properly.</p>
<p>If you’re new to this: draw simple cartoony characters at first.
Don’t even think of attempting anatomical designs until you’ve gotten
comfortable with the simple ones first.<br>
That’s all for now!</p>
