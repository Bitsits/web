  <p>Following the UNICEF Animation Workshop in Prague in 1990, a number
  of animation studios started looking at ways in which they could work with
  UNICEF. Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to embark on a project with
  the UNICEF office in Ecuador. Disney had two goals in Ecuador: 1) train
  people locally to create their own films, and 2) develop a new character
  that could become a spokesperson for important health messages. In 1991,
  representatives from Walt Disney Feature Animation traveled to Ecuador,
  where they began working with Cinearte, a local animation company UNICEF
  had been working with for several years.</p>
  <p><img src="maximo_files/maximo-immu.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" alt="Maximo Immunisation" width="216" align="RIGHT" border="2" height="143">The group first
  chose the health issue they wanted to tackle in this initial film. After
  much debate and discussion, the topic of immunization was selected. Over
  the next several days, Disney Feature Animation executives led the group
  in the process of project designing and shaping. By the end of a week's
  work, a character had been created to convey these UNICEF messages - Maximo.</p>
  <p>Together, UNICEF, Disney and Cinearte decided that the Maximo character
  would be a toucan. He was developed through a long research process that
  looked at different animals and characters peculiar to South America. They
  wanted Maximo to be a friend to children, and a character that people all
  over the region would recognize and identify with. By doing so, Maximo
  would be the kind of character that was free to pass on any health message
  that needed to be told.</p>
  <p><img src="maximo_files/maximo.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" alt="Maximo" width="108" align="LEFT" border="2" height="82">Maximo was first introduced
  to the Latin and South American region in August 1994 through a national
  campaign to eradicate measles. The 3-minute immunization film takes the
  viewer into a small rural village somewhere in Latin America, where new
  parents consider immunizing their baby. Maximo takes the viewer into the
  village and shows the different diseases that could affect their child
  if they weren't to protect him through vaccination. The story is simple,
  short and entertaining, and the main points of the message are reiterated
  by Maximo before he says goodbye.</p>
  <p>With the help of the Maximo film, the immunization campaign was regarded
  as successful by health professionals, the mass media and local children
  and families. In fact, young children wanted to get their shots just so
  they could get their immunization card with Maximo's picture.</p>
  <p>Research showed that Maximo was viewed as credible, was well-accepted
  by both children and adults, and was seen as having an international identity
  rather than solely an Ecuadorian image.</p>
  <p>A second Maximo animated spot was created shortly after the first film,
  this one dealing with the issue of Iodine Deficiency Disorder (IDD). This
  spot explains to mothers that they need a good amount of iodine in their
  diet to ensure a healthy pregnancy. A number of additional Maximo features
  have recently been completed in Ecuador dealing with issues like literacy,
  water and sanitation, measles, oral rehydration therapy, and Vitamin A
  deficiency.</p>
