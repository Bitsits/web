<blockquote>
  <p><img src="meena_files/meena5.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" width="108" align="LEFT" height="132"><b><font size="+2">M</font></b>eena was conceived in
  the early 1990s with the help and guidance of Hanna-Barbera Cartoons. The
  project came out of a need to confront the extreme discrimination against
  girls in the South Asia region of the world. The goal of the Meena initiative
  was to create a girl character that would represent little girls in Bangladesh,
  India, Pakistan and Nepal, dealing with serious issues in the region such
  as education, early marriage, unequal food and work load, while entertaining
  at the same time.</p>
  <p>Coming up with a character that could successfully represent these four
  very different countries was no easy task. Researchers tested many different
  character designs throughout South Asia until they finally came up with
  the current Meena, whose clothes and appearance were general enough that
  the little girl could essentially be from any country within the region.

  to be used in the Meena series. Most important to them was to create a
  cartoon that dealt with the issues relevant to the people in South Asia,
  and to make sure the solutions offered by the film were acceptable as well.
  UNICEF and researchers tested all concepts, storylines, and animatics with
  focus groups before any film was finalized.</p>
  <p>Through the animated characters, children recognize their own experiences
  and find their own voices. As a little girl in a Dhaka slum exclaimed,
  "I want to be like Meena. I want to go to school too." Through
  Meena's story, this little girl had been able to articulate her own aspirations
  and identify her rights. Likewise, parents become engaged with the issues
  and characters and review their own attitudes towards their daughters.</p>
  <p>Today, the first series of 12 Meena episodes is nearly complete, and
  UNICEF is beginning to look for broadcast partners to spread the word.
  Broadcast test runs have shown that there is a wide audience for Meena.The
  series has received a warm welcome in both developing countries and industrialized
  countries alike. To date, the Meena series includes the following episodes:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><img src="meena_files/meena2.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" alt="Count Your Chickens" width="214" align="RIGHT" border="1" height="141"><b>Count Your
    Chickens:</b> Meena's father does not allow her to go to school, but Meena's
    parrot Mithu memorizes the school lessons and teaches her to count. One
    day, she notices that one of her chickens is missing and Meena's quick
    wit helps catch the village thief. Praised by the village headman for her
    counting skills, Meena's parents are encouraged to let her go to school.<br>
    
    </li><li><b>Dividing the Mango:</b> Meena works hard every day, but it is her
    brother who is always given the larger portion of food. It is only when
    Meena and Raju decide to swap jobs for the day that Raju realizes Meena
    works very hard and deserves the same share of the food.<br>
    
    </li><li><b>Saving a Life:</b> Meena's grandmother feels that Meena should not
    be at school, but when Meena's baby sister falls sick with diarrhoea, it
    is Meena and her brother Raju who seek advice from their school teacher.
    The teacher provides them with the life-saving message the importance of
    giving the baby plenty to drink to stop dehydration. This information not
    only saves Rani's life, but also convinces Meena's grandmother that girls
    need to go to school too.<br>
    
    </li><li><b>Will Meena Leave School?:</b> In order to pay back a loan from the
    shopkeeper, Meena's mother may have to go to work, which would mean that
    Meena would have to stay home to look after her baby sister. Meena, with
    the aid of her teacher and all the things she has learned at school, helps
    her mother obtain a loan to buy a cow and a bicycle to start selling milk,
    a business she can run from home. Meena's help ensures that she continues
    to go to school.<br>
    
    </li><li><b>Who's Afraid of the Bully?:</b> Every day, as Meena's friend Rita
    walks to school, the school bullies pick on her. Meena and her friends
    decide that if they stick together they can beat the bullies at their own
    game. Together they stand up to the bully and make him realize that he
    is the ultimate loser and it would be better if they were all friends.<br>
    
    </li><li><b>Three Wishes:</b> Meena dreams of a magic genie that will grant
    her three wishes so that everyone would be healthy and never again get
    sick from poor sanitation and unsafe water. When Meena wakes up she realizes
    that she must make her dream come true. With the help of her brother, Meena
    convinces people to build and use latrines, to use safe water and to wash
    their hands to ensure that they stop the spread of germs and disease. <br>
    
    </li><li><b>Say No to Dowry:</b> Meena's cousin Taara is going to get married,
    and her parents are being asked to pay a large dowry. Meena discovers that
    the shopkeeper and his son are greedily planning to ask for even more dowry
    when the couple is married. The villagers and Taara's parents meet and
    discuss the marriage payment and decide they should say "no"
    to a dowry.<br>
    
    </li><li><b>Too Young To Marry:</b> Meena's uncle has arranged for his daughter
    Rita to marry the shopkeeper's son, Babu. But Rita is only 15 and has not
    yet finished school. With Meena's help, it comes to light that Babu, who
    is studying to be a doctor, does not want to get married yet, especially
    since he knows it is unsafe for young girls to become mothers. To everyone's
    satisfaction, the marriage is postponed until Rita is 18 and has completed
    her education.
